The motive behind the [Waukesha parade attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waukesha_parade_attack) remains unknown for now. The Sheriff's Office does [not believe](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/23/us/waukesha-car-parade-crowd-tuesday/index.html) that it was an act of terrorism. Wisconsin Senators Tammy Baldwin (D) and Ron Johnson (R) have [warned](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/27/us/wisconsin-senators-cease-and-desist-waukesha/index.html) that outsiders may try to exploit the Waukesha tragedy for political purposes. And that's exactly what /tucker_carlson does. To the surprise of no one. We all know by now that /tucker_carlson is a white nationalist hate sub.

The maker of that video, Media2Rise, is part of the white supremacist [Rise Above Movement](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/rise-above-movement-ram). The YouTube channel of Media2Rise has already been [removed](https://www.newsweek.com/youtube-removes-white-supremacist-channel-that-gave-tips-avoiding-homeland-security-1579465) for spreading hate speech several months ago. Yet here they are. Alive and well. On Reddit.

/tucker_carlson has uploaded Alex Jones videos and Nick Fuentes videos in the past. Uploading a Media2Rise video is par for the course. Reddit is turning into a video hoster for right-wing extremists and outright Nazis.",2021-11-28 13:40:41,523

Weird because the west accuse Turkey of killing 1.5 billions armenian. Anyways, Ataturk himself declared ""geNocIde d1dnT HappEneD"". So that's proof it effectively didnt. Armenians too were killing turkish babies in east anatolia so we had to genoc... relocate them all in the syrian desert.  I say, the armenian deserved it. Back in 2019, armenians were genociding azeris in high-Karabash to be a majority and claim the territory, did you ever heard of the Khojaly massacre ? It is a genocide, However West don't like the  turks and i dont know why, so they'll NEVER recognise that Armenian genocided turks. Our brothers the azerbaijanis were simply defending their lands, it was azeri before the  armenians came in the area, armenians dont live here since 2000 years, it's west lies. turks lives in caucasus and anatolia since -4000 BC, the armenians and the greeks simply settled here were the turks lived, we are the victims. Seljuks were liberating the turkish people enslaved by the greeks. Do you know that Cyprus is turk too We didnt invade in 1974 and brought population here, turks living in Cyprus are totally natives. Greeks however are salty about losing the island to the crusaders in 1204 and want to get it back. Greeks are allied with France and France is islamophobic, that's why they dislike Turkey and wish us to die. That is really racist and islamophobic because we just want to live in peace. Our great president Erdogan dont participate in any fights. West is only salty about how great Turkey is. And, Istanbul always had a turk majority.

222,r4vbzt,FAKEASSHROUD69,Nationalists of this subcontinent justifying the separate states of India and Pakistan,"Nationalist historians on both sides have exploited the ""Two Nation theory"" to explain their respective ideologies and the establishment of separate states. Jinnah and the Muslim League are blamed by Indians. Pakistanis rationalise division by claiming that Jinnah agreed to it.   
The truth is that **division was never a done deal until 1946. Jinnah was using Pakistan as a negotiation tool to protect Muslims' rights in independent India.** The whole concept was built on shared sovereignty between Hindus and Muslims, with **Hindustan and Pakistan becoming two different federal states inside the Union of India.** 

Jinnah and Ambedkar were two brilliant constitutionalists who saw that India will eventually fall under the control of upper-caste Hindus and desired to protect the rights of their respective groups. 

The Muslim League now had its base in North India, where Muslims were in the minority. While the Muslim elites Jinnah required were mainly in Punjab and Bengal. Jinnah was always in favour of residuary powers with the states, whilst Congress was in favour of a strong central government. The threat Jinnah saw was that **if residuary powers were given to states, Congress governments in North India would soon be ruled by upper-caste Hindus, while in Punjab & Bengal it was the Muslims in the majority who would dominate administration.** The way the constitutional structure was devised, Muslim representation in Punjab and Bengal assemblies would have been less than their population percentage, as for North India it would have been greater than their population proportion.

Thus, there existed a schism that Jinnah wanted to bridge, and the concept of shared sovereignty between Hindustan and Pakistan was established, in which each state would have to protect its minorities, namely Hindus in Punjab and Bengal and Muslims in North India. **Given that Congress had repeatedly capitulated to Hindu Nationalists and ignored to oppose Hindu nationalism and the violence it generated, Jinnah saw a very serious threat to Muslims in North India.** 

**Jinnah was ready to sign the Cabinet Mission Plan when it was provided since it matched most of the conditions he sought and partition could have been avoided. The Congress, on the other hand, disapproved, fearing a power loss and the authority to speak for all of India.**

So Mountbatten offered Partition, and that devastated Bombay fella accepted it. **Jinnah insisted on open borders between the two Punjabs and Bengals till the very end, allowing free movement of commodities and people. However, the Congress, led by Nehru, rejected.** 

Jinnah, ironically, wanted that the inaugural session of Pakistan's constitutional assembly be convened in Delhi, which Nehru once again opposed. Jinnah had recently purchased a home in Delhi, and someone had questioned as to why he had done so. ***""Sahab, aate jaate rahenge***"", Jinnah remarked.

Jinnah's vision for India and Pakistan was vastly different from what is commonly depicted and how events unfolded. **Partition, rather than validating the Two-Nation Theory, was a rejection of it.**

As India and Pakistan face the demons of majoritarianism, it's worth revisiting Jinnah and his ideals. He was a constitutionalist, nationalist, and lawyer par excellence, as well as a controversial personality for a variety of reasons, notably black day and enforcing Urdu in East Pakistan.   
But so were Nehru and Gandhi, and **Congress was a haven for some blatant bigots.** For various reasons, Jinnah and Ambedkar recognised the Congress and India's oncoming fate better than anybody else and had their own options to make.

224,p5ju5u,machotacoman,I think the libertarian to white nationalist pipeline is real,"tl;dr. Sticking to 100% personal responsibility risks concluding that there's something inherently wrong with entire demographics of people in order to justify why they're failing in a presumed fair society.

These are the steps I think the pipeline goes through:

1. Freedom good government bad
2. What's one of the biggest manifestations of government tyranny? Taxes.
3. What's one of the biggest drivers of taxes? The welfare state.
4. Who uses welfare the most? The poor.
5. What demographics are disproportionately poor? Blacks & Hispanics (for simplicity)
6. Why are they poor? Because they're not producing highly valued goods and services to earn high pay. They're all making 'bad decisions'.
7. Why?

This is the fork in the road. It's either:
A: a long and nuanced history of global geopolitics, government policy, and socioeconomics.
B: something ""inherent"" to them.

I believe that to some libertarians who fall down this pipeline, option A is incompatible with their individualist, personal responsibility outlook. If the government is legally banning someone from many capital markets, economic sectors, and talent pools, then they have few opportunities to prosper. It takes away some of the personal responsibility for not prospering because the state apparatus is being used to actively hold them down. So, then go with option b to maintain the 100% personal responsibility angle.

One might say that it's their 'culture', then wonder 'where does the culture come from?' Then it's either option A or B again. Culture comes from long-term group experiences, or something inherent to them. At which point you hit the genetic argument. I think this is how we end up with people like Stefan Molyneux, libertarian and white nationalist. Citing IQ differences for why non-whites are incompatible with a free society.

I hope this wasn't too rambling, and I'm interested in anyone else's take on the pipeline idea.",2021-08-16 11:41:47,235

I have been in love with Norway since I was a kid. I have (unfortunately) never been there before. I live in the Netherlands now but I was born in Baghdad, Iraq.   


The reason for this post is because I want to know from you guys that have experienced Norway, my wife and I have this argument a lot. If I could I want to move and live in Norway because I'm not that happy living here. There are a few reasons for that, but (institutionalized) racism is one of them.   
My wife also loves Norway, but her arguments for not moving are the following two: It's a difficult language to master and she's a person that feels at her most comfortable if she can truly express herself with language. The second thing is, she thinks that my issue about the racism part might not be that much different in Norway as North European countries have this reputation or stigma perhaps(?) that they're more nationalist or more bound to be racist than other countries.

&#x200B;

I have no clue if that's true or not and she's also just guessing, but I just wanted to put it out there. 

I'm terribly sorry if I have offended anyone with this post as that's not my intention. I truly love Norway and its people and culture and it has been a long life dream of mine to visit the country and perhaps even live there one day.

I was hoping that perhaps some of you might give me a better insight in the Norwegian culture regarding this topic and I have to say it again: I'm truly sorry if I have offended you. I'm not trying to offend anyone here and this is a question I'm trying to figure out pure out of curiosity. I have nothing but love and respect for the country and its people and culture. 

&#x200B;

Others point out that [such nationalism is oxymoronic](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/great-delusion-liberal-dreams-and-international-realities-by-john-j-mearsheimer-new-haven-yale-university-press-2018-328p-3000-cloth/6FD4E7A143B7AE5086042C03F83F49C4), that ""modern liberal ideology - a function of liberalism's commitments to individualism, inalienable rights for all humans, and state-led social engineering,"" is incompatible with ""the more powerful and abiding forces of nationalism at the center of international relations.""

Given the varying views of what constitutes American nationalism, along with nationalistic sentiments being closely tied to militaristic fervor, how does American nationalism strengthen or detract from national security?",2021-11-29 14:58:56,1
273,r0iz1x,DjangoUBlackBastard,What is your argument against Black Nationalism that's not racist?,"Imma get into this because in another thread there was a conversation that went down where I was trying to inform someone on what Black Nationalism is and they basically revealed that their anti-black nationalist POV comes from the standpoint that the descendants of slaves do not deal with racism and prejudice in the US.

First I'll give a strict argument for Black Nationalism:

- Unlike other groups the descendants of US slaves were kidnapped into america and forced to be second class citizens in perpetuity.

- The only other group that didn't willingly choose to be Americans are Native Americans. [They have sovereignty and sovereign lands.](https://www.ncsl.org/legislators-staff/legislators/quad-caucus/an-issue-of-sovereignty.aspx#:~:text=Tribal%20sovereignty%20refers%20to%20the,to%20regulate%20their%20internal%20affairs.&text=Cherokee%20Nation%20v.)

- African Americans (what I'll be referring to the descendants of US slaves as going forward) are a unique ethnic group native to the USA. Telling people they can leave is not realistically any different from telling them to go back to Africa. Leave and go where, another country not welcoming to us that I'm not native to?

- Native American sovereignty whether you want to call it failed or not on it's merits (I'd argue with the governments giving land and money to corporations instead of people it was sabotaged) hasn't left the Native American community in any worse of a state than integration has left the black community in. We're still both at the bottom by all metrics.

Now I've seen plenty of arguments against it. Never any that weren't based in either the idea that black people unlike everyone else don't have a right to sovereignty or based in the fact that America actually isn't that bad and is making steps towards improving.

I don't think I need to explain why the first point is wrong, but for the second point here's basic statistics on quality of life we can use to prove integration is failing:

[School segregation is worse than it was in 1969 and getting worse.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2018%2F3%2F5%2F17080218%2Fschool-segregation-getting-worse-data&psig=AOvVaw2RfV7s5xxYsFj2DahKdVyY&ust=1637773640578000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCIjTibP8rvQCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)

[Income inequality has not decreased at all since integration.](https://equitablegrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/maduca-fig-1.png)

[Black wealth is projected to be a median of $0 by 2053.](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/sep/13/median-wealth-of-black-americans-will-fall-to-zero-by-2053-warns-new-report)

[Black incarceration is way up post integration.](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/incarceration1.jpg)

[Black millennials in the 4th quintile of wealth have less wealth than both white and latino millennials in the 2nd quintile of wealth.](https://www.newamerica.org/millennials/reports/emerging-millennial-wealth-gap/the-millennial-racial-wealth-gap/)

[I can't find the study now but I remember reading a study that showed the wealth of white millennials at this age trail white boomers by 5%. The wealth of black millennials at this age trail black boomers by 52%. Remember black boomers were raised in a segregated world.](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/march/millennials-catching-up-earlier-generational-wealth)

^^ Thanks to u/ButGravityAlwaysWins for finding it.

[Black men deal with the brunt of racial backlash in America and are being targeted in American society in a way where what kind of wealth they have is nowhere near as important a factor as their race in determining their quality of life.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/21/17139300/economic-mobility-study-race-black-white-women-men-incarceration-income-chetty-hendren-jones-porter)


TL;DR: Racial quality of life gaps are still increasing and the racial wealth gap is completely insufficient in explaining the reasons why. Black Nationalism exists because many black people think integration was designed to fail and never intended to give us equal rights but to instead placate us. As such the only logical thing to do would be to let black people govern themselves similar to Native Americans.



I know this is a long OP but I really want some well thought out comments here. I know if I did not include some type of background into why black nationalism is even a thing, with most posters here having no idea of what black nationalism is it'd be compared to white nationalism. But if I put this large OP maybe the people that have the time to read it can actually come up with a good rebuttal that's not one of the few I mentioned above.

EDIT: Let me be more specific but I mean all types of Black Nationalism. On the less extreme end you have groups like the Panthers and Nation of Islam. They fight for a sovereign nation that's still a part of the US and not under the jurisdiction of the US government. Like of the Navajo. On the other end of the spectrum there's proposals like The New Republic of Afrika that want the deep south annexed into a separate country with the blessing of America similar to how Israel did it. For the most part people do not mind integrated living societies, but they do mind integrated political influence (basically if you're white you can live there and technically run for office but you'll have no hope of being elected). Hope that answers those questions.",2021-11-23 11:56:06,0
274,r42mu7,Captain_Cackwurst,(Spoilers Extended) Hizdahr and ghiscari nationalism,"Now this might be a no-brainer, but I think it might lend some insight into what's going on between the pyramids of Meereen.

Hizdahr appears to be what is a typical Ghiscari noble: A trader (of lives), not a warrior; rich and extravagant to the brink; lusting for power and coin; yet in the end weak and unfit to rule. He buys up the Fighting Pits when their course is low, in what seems to be a Wolf-of-Wallstreet-type bold move, and then pesters Dany until she reopens them so he can make big profit. He tells Dany that he only cares for being King because of his own vanity, and the only thing he really does as King is fulfilling his weird fixation with the Fighting Pits, finally reopening them to make le big profit.

But I always thought his attitude to Kingship fishy. Why does he treat his crown as if it was simply an accessoire? Shouldn't he be aware that there comes great risk and a lot of grey hair with being king? It's not a fun job, and Hizdahr only seems to learn that when Dany is gone and he has to deal with the Yunkai'i by himself. And where does his fixation with the Fighting Pits stem from? Did he really believe that, if only he annoys Dany for long enough, she would give in and allow him to make profit? He put a fortune into buying (admittetly, cheap) Fighting Pits, so it does seem he was either a) really certain that they would be reopened or b) he bought them for more reason than just coin.

So what I'm thinking is this: Hizdahrs make-up as an extravagant, superficial, narcissist merchant-noble is a shtick, for the most part at least. He is in that regard very similar to Illyrio, who also plays the fat lad that's only interested in money and cool titles, besides actually having ""ulterior"" motives that he tries to hide.

Although Hizdahr isn't really hiding his motive that well, but it appears that noone around him (neither Dany nor Barristan at least) really takes him serious when he is upfront about it. I'm talking about this quote by him:

*""Before you came Meereen was dying. Our rulers were old men with withered cocks and crones whose puckered cunts were dry as dust. They sat atop their pyramids sipping apricot wine and talking of the glories of the Old Empire whilst the centuries slipped by and the very bricks of the city crumbled all around them. Custom and caution had an iron grip upon us till you awakened us with fire and blood. A new time has come, and new things are possible.""*

If I'm correct and Hizdahr is to be taken serious about his belief here, he thinks that Meereen, and the general Ghiscari culture, pre-Daenerys was stuck, decadent and dying. Any economic innovation was stifled by slavery and the nobility was too busy with endulging in worldly hedonism than to do anything else. If Hizdahr truly believs this, how would it fit to him being a stuck-up, hedonistic narcissist-noble himself? I believe Hizdahr actually has some form of an idea he fights for: A renewed Ghiscari culture, led by a renewed Meereen.

In Hizdahrs Meereen, slavery has no place. As we learn about Meereen, and likely the other Ghiscari cities as well, their economy was once not just reliant on selling slaves. They mined copper in an age where ""bronze ruled the world"", but at some point bronze lost to iron - the same as Ghis lost to the Valyrians - and the prime value of Meereen shifted from copper to slaves. To someone who studied Ghiscari history - something any noble boy in Slavers Bay will have done - it might seem that with the advent of slavery came the downfall of the old greatness. Slavery might have been what saved the last Ghiscari cities, preventing their complete economic collapse, but it came with a price: As I said, it locked the economy in place, made it dependent on the slave-buying cities (free Cities, Qarth) as well as the slave providers (Dothraki, Corsars), and prevents innovation and renewal. As Hizdahr sees it, the slave-economy of Meereen and her sisters is just a downfall in slow motion. He intends to break Meereen free of this yoke of history and therefore is on the same side as Dany: anti-slavery. But not out of humanistic reasons (slavery = bad for humans), but for nationalistic reasons (slavery = bad for Meeren).

We learn that Hizdahr is not a humanist in any way. He wants to reopen the fighting pits, after all; and when he reopens them, he plans to have the unsuspecting Tyrion and Penny to be devoured by lions. So, he doesn't really care for some kind of 'enlightenment subject' that has unalienable rights or even a religious subject that is unalienably divine - which would be the historical idealistic arguments against slavery in our world. That's where he diverts from Dany in their politics on slavery. But why does he care so much about the Fighting Pits?

Two reasons:

a) Money, after all. We are told that the fighting pits of Meeren provide like 1/10th of the income. After the dissolvement of slavery and the whole chaos in Slavers Bay, Meereenese economy is in shambles. If Meereen wants to reemerge as a strong nation it must first survive the economically traumatic shift from slavery to non-slavery, and it needs to attract traders that come for some other reason than slaves.

b) Nationalism. Dissolving slavery kills part of the core identity of Meereen. Another part of that identity are the Fighting Pits. We learn that there are Fighting Pits in all Ghiscari cities, but that whose in Meereen are biggest and best, the Meereenese can be proud of their Pits and show themselves and the other Ghiscari that they are the best of the Ghiscari cities.

But Hizdahr not only diverts from Dany on his reasons for anti-slavery, his relationship to her is quite the complicated one. In Barristans chapters we get the idea that his rule is really dependent on having Daenerys by his side, he is by himself a rather weak ruler. But this seems somewhat odd: isn't Daenerys the one that needed Hizdahr to solidify her power in Meereen? Why, when Daenerys is gone, do the pyramids start shaking under Hizdahrs feet? When Ser Barristan arrests Hizdahr at the end of ADwD, he takes note that Hizdahr has a tapestry on a wall of his private chambers. The tapestry shows the glory of old Ghis and a lot of enslaved Valyrians. This not only hammers the point home that: Yeah, Hizdahr is a Ghiscari nationalist and believes in Ghiscary supremacy; it's also somewhat telling of what he thinks of Valyrians. And this, I believe, is something Dany constantly underestimates during her time in Meereen: She thinks the Ghiscary nobles and the Sons of the Harpy hate her for dissolving slavery, but many of them, i believe, hate her more for being Valyrian. Daenerys is a great catalyst for Ghiscari nationalism in Meereen, because she is a wonderful 'Other', an outsider that gives the Meereenese/Ghiscari a coherent identity.

What Hizdahr is doing when he becomes king is emulating his tapestry. He personifies the glory of Old Ghis, whilst Dany personifies the subjugated Valyrians. So when Dany disappears, what happens? Hizdahr lost his 'Other', he loses esentially the 'enemy' that keeps his 'people' banded together, and shit breaks lose. The SotH start killing again\*, because likely the pyramids start scheming against each other again, which we see in the schemes the Shavepate starts up as soon as Dany is away. Dany, in a weird way, was Hizdahrs scepter that showed everyone that he is king.

Now the relationship of Hizdahr to Dany might even be more complicated. IIRC he at some point wants to make a son to Daenerys that will be ""Harpy and Dragon"", so in a way he doesn't (just) want to subjugate the Valyrian Other, but he wants to integrate it into Meereenese identity. This seeems to me to be coherent with his ideas of a nationalistic renewal: He doesn't just look to restore the glory days of old (as his tapestry might wrongfully lead to believe) as he knows that they are long gone, he rather longs for a new glory, one that overshadows the old one.

So, what's the Graces got to do with it? I suspect they might have reason to be allied with a ghiscari nationalist such as Hizdahr. The Graces might, too, long for ye olden days, when everything was nicer and the Graces themselves might have had more power. Gallaza Galare is the one that tells Dany about the economic calamities that befell Meereen after all, and she does appear anti-slavery too, but, like Hizdahr, in a more pragmatic sense than Dany.

Okay, this became a longer essay than expected; and I said that this would help understand what's going on behind the scenes in Meereen. After all, who cares what ideology Hizdahr has? Well, if the popular theories are correct that Gallaza Galare is 'the Harpy' - or at least affiliated with the leadership of the Harpy - it is likely that Hizdahr is not too far from them ideologically too. If I am correct that Hizdahr isn't pro-slavery and Gallaza isn't pro-slavery either, it seems proceedingly unlikely that the Sonst of the Harpy are a pro-slavery terror group. I believe it more likely that the SotH are, first-and-foremost, an anti-Valyrian terror group, and that they are not ideologically settled on their position towards slavery. The likes of Gallaza and Hizdahr probably form a faction within the group, and when they put Hizdahr on the throne, this is their testimony that they can 'subjugate' the Dragon (remember how hellbent Gallaza is on getting Dany to constantly follow Ghiscari customs, symbolically subjugating herself).

So, which factions do we have among the Meereenese nobles after all this?

\- **Pro-Slavery Ghiscari Traditionalists**, these should be the staunchest opponents of Dany as they like nothing about her rule and they are likely to be among the SotH

\- the likes of Galazza and Hizdahr, **Anti-Slavery Ghiscari Nationalists**. As we saw above, although they are generally anti-Valyrian, they seem to want to 'use' Daenerys, forming a synthesis of the Harpy and the Dragon and ushering a new glory for Meereen. They likely are in conflict with the Pro-Slavery-faction within the SotH, but seem to have the upper hand in the organization

\- the **Shavepates. Anti-Slavery, Pro-Daenerys**. Now this is a weird bunch, because generally they aren't that different in their ideals from Hizdahr: they like ""New Meereen"" and want to abandon stupid traditions, but they seem to hate Hizdahr to the teeth and we don't really know the reason, besides maybe that the Shavepates are unwilling to work with pro-slavery factions. It is notable that the chief-shavepate, and the only one we really get to know, Skahaz, is a schemer and a powerplayer who wants to hurt the other pyramids as much as possible. It might be possible that the Shavepates are simply opportunists and smaller pyramids who disdain the big noble houses. That would certainly be an ironic twist to how the conflicts of Meereen are presented to the reader. It might also be that my theory falls apart at this point.

I have written long enough. What do you think, what are the factions within the pyramids of Meereen? I think it is obvious that the Meereenese nobility is more fractured than it appears, and not just pro-slavery vs. anti-slavery guys. Thanks for reading!

Be it on Youtube in vlogs similar to that of Elvish Yadav or in courts by educated people like Mr. Sai Jagdeep. Or for that matter any politician or a party spokesperson.

281,r0coi3,pihkaltih,Zionism is just Jewish equivalent of Evangelical Christianity. Ultra-Nationalism under the guise of Religion iconography.,"One of the major things I've noticed with arguing most Zionists, is that, they literally worship *Israel as their god*. To these people, the actual Jewish religion as it was, is somewhat secondary, as is the idea of really a ""Jewish"" people.

When you look at their arguments, and how in particular, actual proper Zionists have quite a lot of disdain for the diaspora and are perfectly fine with antisemitism in service of Israel to the point you get Zionists marching arm in arm with groups like the BNP and other far-right European psychopaths, that to them the *""Jewish people"" really just means, Israeli, and the Jewish faith they support, really is just belief in Israel as a Jewish national project.*

They don't even hide this as well, go read any release by the Board of Deputies or Labour against Antisemitism etc and they all constantly talk about how *Israel is the core central belief of Judaism*, which is of course, fucking nonsense considering the diaspora have survived as many different unique cultural Jewish groups for thousands of years across Africa, Europe and Asia outside of Israel. (negating the diaspora and it's existence is one of the core aspects of Zionist theory *◊©◊ú◊ô◊ú◊™ ◊î◊í◊ú◊ï◊™*) 

American Evangelical Christianity, is the syncretism between God and Nation, and Jesus and the Republican party. When Evangelical's talk about god and Jesus, *they're really talking about the concept of America as a nation idea and Jesus is pretty much whoever the Republican figurehead is at that moment/Reagan*. If you end up debating Evangelicals and you're familiar with debating Zionists, you really start to notice how much they sound like Zionists, You realise you're simply arguing with *Ultra-Nationalists who have turned their religion into Nation-worshipping.*

This is also why Zionists are quick to call any Non-Zionist Jews as ""fake jews"" and Kapos, when ""Israel is central to Judaism"" is your core belief, then what are the Jews who don't like Israel or are Antizionist? They're of course, *""fake Jews""*. This is how you get the bizarre situation where Zionist Christians, become ""honourary Jews"" and are often in the media talking down to anti-Zionist Jewish groups like Jewdas, JVL, IJAN, JVP and holocaust survivors like Hajo Meyer and figures like Finkelstein as ""fake jews"" and ""antisemites"". This is why in the UK, you see the Labour party, mass expelling Antizionist Jews for ""antisemitism"", while those calling Antizionist Jews ""Holocaust supporters"" (Kapos) and ""fake Jews"" get promotions in the party.

This is why I actually don't think Zionists are lying when they call any and all criticism of Israel or Zionism, antisemitism. They in their hearts, are hurt by criticism of Israel, just like a Jew would be hurt if you called them a money-grubbing Jew, *they legitimately believe you are shitting on Judaism when you criticise Israel.*

Here's the thing though, *no religion has a right to not be criticised and you have no right to not be offended.* Sure the Zionist is deeply hurt by the criticism of Israel, but, so? Why does that matter? It doesn't make the facts less valid.

What I also find so weird about the establishment getting behind Zionism's bonkers Antisemitism crying, is that we all openly acknowledge this about Evangelical Christianity and Evangelical Christianity in the mainstream is a laughing stock which is just as offensive to Evangelicals as criticising Israel is to Antizionists.

However, if you really think about the question, ""what is the opposite of nationalism""... you realize that its flip side is a person who has identification or allegiance to some *other* nation or power and someone who does *not* support the nation. 

For example, look at the example of Ireland... over the history of the last several centuries, the idea of Irish nationalism was a strong movement followed by many native Irish people through which they fought for self rule and independence of the Irish people in their own land against the foreign oppression of the English. Meanwhile, the opposing force to the Irish nationalists were the Unionists, who were largely Protestants in the north of Ireland with links to England who wished Ireland to remain under the control of the English. It was only through this nationalism that the Irish ever achieved independence from the English. As such, you can see this example proves my point, that the foil to nationalism is a denial of domestic allegiance and instead an allegiance to powers abroad. While one can sit here all day and argue what is too much or too little nationalism, it can unarguably be asserted that being nationalist means you embrace domestic rule and a refusal to be controlled by foreign powers. To say you are *against* nationalism means you embrace it's opposite, which is foreign control of your nation and an loyalty to outside forces which don't have the interests of the domestic population at heart.

Having said all that, i freely admit i am nationalist and think that anyone who cherishes their own country, who wishes to see it governed domestically and who oppose the meddling of foreign powers should also proudly admit that they are also nationalist.",2021-10-28 11:52:08,72

In the original post, I was happy to read and interact with your agreements and criticisms of my original critique.

I would refrain from using the word ""Patriotic"", seeing as that implies support for the existing social order - though ""Nationalist Socialism"" sounds... well, I don't need to explain why. For the purposes of this I will use the term Socialist/Communist Nationalism.

We know that a Communist can and must be at the same time be an Internationalist and a Nationalist - though Communist Nationalism is far different from Reactionary Nationalism. National Liberation - that is, the movement wherein one imperialised, colonised or otherwise oppressed nation or community seeks to liberate itself from a foreign overlord - is a core part of Marxism-Leninism; this I am sure we are all aware of and I have stressed in my previous post. However, in the past, there have been national-liberation movements across the world, some of which have taken on a Socialist Character. In fact, almost all major movements in the last one hundred or so years have. Yet, none of these have taken place in the settler colonies of the world, save for maybe Korea. Of all the historical settler-colonies that have existed, much of them have been liberated from their colonial overlords long ago. South and Central America are free from Spain and Portugal, Asia is free from Japan, the Balkans and Arabia are free from Turkey, Eurasia is largely free from Russia, South Africa overthrew its white minority leadership. Of the settler colonies that remain - The Commonwealths of Canada, Australia, New Zealand (Aotearoa) and the United States of America - only one of them is not still under the rule of a foreign leader *de jure.* It is also in these countries, as well as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, that the most amount of Capital is concentrated in the modern era - these states we refer to as the ""Anglosphere"", or, the ""Imperial Core"".

Revolution in the United Kingdom does not need to deal with the question of Colonialism, since it is an isle inhabited by its indigenous peoples. For this piece we will be focusing on settler-colonies.

Is it possible to be a Communist and a Nationalist in these states? Yes. But it is important to differentiate between Reactionary Nationalism and Socialist Nationalism.

**1:** **Differentiating between the two forms of Nationalism**

The main component of Nationalism is a deep love of one's country and a desire to see it do well and prosper, sometimes to the detriment of other countries - this we call National Chauvinism, and we reject wholeheartedly.

Nationalism can be used as a tool of subjugation or of Liberation - of this we are all aware. The difference between each can be easily identified, namely, in whether or not they uphold the social order of the day, and what that social order is. A key example of this is in Australia and the difference between Communist Nationalism and Reactionary Nationalism. Australia is a British Settler-Colony, and to this day a direct *de jure* puppet of the British Empire, *de facto* a puppet of the American^(1); thus making it a second-world country according to the three worlds theory. Do all Nationalists and ""Patriots"" in Australia seek to liberate Australia from its status as a second-class colony of foreign masters? Hardly!

Some of them do carry the Eureka Flag, but do they mourn the martyrs who died at that stockade? Do they celebrate the victory their martyrdom paid for? Do they celebrate Ned Kelly's^(2) legacy as our own Robin Hood, as our own *Koba,* are they outraged at our government that routinely sends our sons and daughters to bleed and die in foreign fields on the orders of uncaring masters? Do they see any of the vast beauty our motherland holds, do they tremble in anger at seeing it plundered by foreign capital? Are they outraged at the massacring of our native peoples, the first nations of this land, and their continued subjugation?  **No, they do not!** These reactionaries do not celebrate Australia, they celebrate being *white IN Australia!*

**Any challenging to the current conditions in Australia would threaten the social cohesion of our country, would challenge the doctrine of white supremacy that this country was founded on, which, to the reactionary, is wholly unacceptable.** They wave our national flag, the one stained with the Union Jack, rather than our Eureka cross - quite literally adopting the iconography of white supremacy and colonialism. The same applies to reactionary Nationalists in America, Canada, and New Zealand, all of which are home to **""Nationalist"" groups who do not serve their countries, but rather, serve the interests of their national or International Bourgeoisie - upon which it can be called into question whether or not these ""Patriots"" are even Patriots at all, selling out the majority of their homelands to a gilded few.** As Communists, it should be obvious to us that this is not Nationalism or Patriotism in the slightest, but National Chauvinism, reactionary nationalism, as they seek to uphold the current (or past) social order. On that note, we can say safely that it is not, in fact, reactionary to be a Nationalist in a Settler-Colonial state, provided one is a *Socialist* Nationalist.

**2:** **Nationalism and National Liberation in Settler-Colonial States**

Across Australia's history, never have the Australian people ever truly been in charge of it. We are still a colony, for all of our history we have been under either direct or indirect rule from London or Washington. Many egregious crimes have been committed in our past, but all of them, or a majority of them, were perpetrated by British Colonial authorities, or ordered by governments subservient as puppets to Britain or America. They, quite literally, happened under the Union Jack, which still stains our national flag today. A class analysis of Australia reveals that little has changed since 1788:

|1788|2021|
|:-|:-|
|British Colonial Authorities|National Bourgeoisie and Political Bureaucrats|
|(Rich) Free Settlers, Merchants|Labour Aristocracy/Petty bourgeoisie|
|Convicts, Poorer Free Settlers|Proletarians|
|Indigenous Australians, Coolies^(3) and other immigrant labour|Indigenous Australians, immigrant proletarians|

There are multiple phenomenon to be observed in this analysis of Australian classes and how they have changed the historic relations between them:

* 2.1: While Convicts were certainly settlers themselves, they were by no means eager to be in Australia. They themselves were victims of capital, often charged with petty crimes such as the theft of food or other vitals - while normally they would've been sentenced to death, Australia was thought of as hell on earth, and so they were sent here. Torn from their families and homelands, many Convicts outright defected to join indigenous resistance groups active in the country, particularly from 1788 to \~1815.
* 2.2: Class society was present in Australia from the founding of the first colony at Botany Bay - the Colonials, the Convicts, and the Indigenous Australians. The British Colonial Authorities and Richer Free Settlers often cooperated with each other at the expense of the Enslaved Convicts and the Indigenous Population - tensions that eventually boiled over into the 1854 Eureka Stockade and the formation of Australia's incredibly strong Union Culture. Poorer Free Settlers and Immigrants, which began to arrive around the time of the Napoleonic Wars, were also cast aside by the higher classes of Australian society as part of its growing Bourgeoisie.
* 2.3: Similarly, as the Australian proletariat began to form, it consistently sided with the aforementioned Coolies and Indigenous Resistance, as well as other immigrant labour. During the Eureka Stockade^(4), miners refused to allow British Colonial Authorities to divide the crowd by racial lines, insisting the Chinese labourers striking with them were one of them. This tradition of solidarity continued through the rest of the 19th century and the 20th to this day, and is especially strong with Unions.
* 2.4: In the modern day, this class arrangement has hardly changed. Poorer ""settlers"" and first, second or third generation immigrant labour make up an overwhelming majority of the Proletariat, whilst the ruling class is overwhelmingly white, and overwhelmingly backed by foreign capital, particularly that in the United States. This racial character of our wider Class Society is no doubt a remnant of the colonialism, and evidence of its continuing effects, particularly in the lower social-economic status of indigenous communities.

Basic knowledge of history tells us that the current colonial government of Australia is in direct combat with the very existence of indigenous people, and its continued existence is an existential threat to the survival of Indigenous Australians. However, this class analysis also reveals another thing: that **for a majority of Australian Proletarians, indigenous or not - that is, the majority of society - the status of Australia as a Colonial State is** ***also*** **unsatisfactory.** The class society of 1788 has by no means disappeared or even transformed in any significant way. In America and India, for instance, the petty Bourgeoisie in those countries were able to spearhead national liberation and ascend to becoming the Big Bourgeoisie - ***this has not happened in Australia.*** The Big Bourgeoisie in Australia is overwhelmingly composed of *foreign,* not domestic, Capital. Excluding banks (much of which are formerly state-owned enterprises) and joint anglo-australian mineral concerns - which export a majority *from* Australia as part of the movement of finance capital and raw material - the largest corporate groups in Australia are non-Australian. Even seemingly domestic Australian corporations, such as Macquarie Group, a Banking and Infrastructure Firm, began as a subsidiary of the British Hill Samuel & Co, Ltd. Foreign monopoly on Australia is so extensive that a majority of Australian raw resources is exported abroad - mostly Asia and Europe - and in the media, which is dominated by the American Murdoch Dynasty and the Australian Packer Dynasty.

This is not to say that domestic Capitalists and Bourgeois do not exist in this country, it is not difficult at all to follow the lives of 19th century Businessmen and how they became the absurdly rich billionaires today - all of them began as what we could consider ""Rich Settlers"", and made the natural progression through a colonial capitalist society to become the bourgeoisie and then the big bourgeoisie - though, ultimately, they serve the interests of Capital, which is in the interest of the major Bourgeoisie, the international masters of finance.

**3:** **The task of Australian Communists and the Australian National Revolution**

In summary, Australia is a second-world nation oppressed by foreign masters and has never ruled itself. It is an imperialised nation that is granted the privilege of being able to oppress some minor nations itself (Papua New Guinea, Timor and Nauru to be specific), and to partake in the subjugation of other, third world nations. Reactionary Nationalists in Australia are not and do not represent the interests of Australia as a whole, and are, therefore, the *opposite* of patriotic, of nationalist - they are National Chauvinists. It is therefore the task of the Australian Proletariat, black and white, indigenous and convict, to unite for the mutual interest of destroying colonial capitalism and taking control of their homeland. While White Australians may not be indigenous to this land, there is no doubt that the process of history has made them apart of it, though the former point is still valid, **Australian workers** ***must*** **bear in mind that indigenous Australians have suffered substantially more than they have**. I am technically an eighth-generation Immigrant from what is now Germany, but I bear no connection to *Die Deutsches Vaterland.* The liberation of a Colonial settler-state can only occur with the full participation of all members of its proletarian class, regardless of race or national origin. In a colonial state, the most revolutionary act one can embark on is its destruction. The Australian revolution *must* be a national one.

**4: Nationalism and National Liberation in the United States**

The United States is not like Australia. As such, a special analysis of both countries must be carried out.

In my original post I heavily criticised the policy of ""Patriotic Socialism"" as it was espoused by that of Haz in the video ""Patriotic Socialism: America vs. America"". I should like to make it clear that I do believe that Communist Nationalism is possible in the United States - just not as Haz believes it.

In the first post, u/Professional-Way1833 shared a criticism of my view that patriotism is 100% justified in the face of an external invader that seeks to economically and politically dominate one's country. They agreed with me, but went on to say that :

>*...to some extent, this is what the PS* \[Patriotic Socialist\] *people are saying. They are saying 'The American people ARE attacked by an outside force. They are attacked by the bourgeoise and government.'*  
>  
>*The workers of America black or white, bear no responsibility for the government, because in the USA, the working masses have ZERO control over it. It oppresses the world, it oppresses the masses in it's own border. It oppresses POC, and also white workers. Sure, white workers are oppressed less, but they are still oppressed, and the imbalance of oppression is changing.*

Whilst I cannot say that I completely know every argument those that espouse the doctrine of Patriotic Socialism are making (I was only responding to one video), this is an objectively correct assessment and I believe a key point to understanding the role of Communist Nationalism in the American Proletarian movement. In America, modern day American proletarians, white or not, bear no responsibility for the crimes of the past because they were not in control when they happened, they did not perpetrate them; they did not order them - this I have already said myself about Australia. Over time, countless peoples have made America their home. For a majority of American workers they, although not indigenous to the lands they inhabit, have become apart of them. This is the material reality that we find ourselves in. It is indeed a tragedy that countless indigenous nations, civilisations and peoples were systematically eradicated in the name of white settlement. The effects of such actions still linger, although the *direct* actions of genocide, ethnic cleansing, enslavement and so on have largely ceased. There is still displacement. There is still erasure. But such crimes cannot be undone, only healed from.

The fundamental error in ""Patriotic Socialism"" I find that I have not already addressed was brought up by comrade u/Mrfish31. He said:

>*No, honoring and respecting communists (eg the black panthers, workers movements) and abolitionists (eg John Brown) is not ""patriotic"", being proud of ""the American tradition of rebellion"". These people were literally the opposite of ""tradition"". They were enemies and traitors to the USA* (A good thing!) *and in many cases were executed by the USA. The ""American tradition"" is white supremacy and slavery. To be patriotic in such a country is to implicitly support it, no matter how much you insist that you ""actually just support the right parts of it's history"".*

I elaborated upon this a bit further in my reply to u/Professional-Way1833, but essentially: ""Patriotic Socialists"" believe that organisations and individuals (such as the Black Panthers, for instance) made advancements *because* of the US, rather than in spite of it. John Brown's rebellion was crushed by the United States state apparatus, civil rights leaders, labour activists, unionists and Communists were actively persecuted by the United States Government. These people and movements should indeed be celebrated and honoured, but not because they were Americans, but because they were Communists, abolitionists, labour organisers, unionists and civil rights leaders. Geronimo fought against the United States. Eugene Debs did as well. Patriotic Socialism calls for the celebration of American tradition - rebellion, progress, Liberty and Democracy, etc - in spite of America's genocidal present, but fails to understand that such rebellion and progress happened *in spite* of the United States, engaging in direct conflict with the United States and what it stands for. Perhaps in ideas, yes, these individuals and organisations fought for something ""American"", but in concrete practice, they fought directly against everything that is American. This is something u/MrFish31 pointed out. In ideas, yes, the United States can be considered to be or have been a vanguard of democracy and liberty, freedom et. al, but in practice it is a vanguard of imperial colonialism and white supremacy.

So, what is to be done? as the two aforementioned users both correctly pointed out, white American workers are still oppressed. Not nearly as much as indigenous nations and african-american communities, but still oppressed regardless. The ""Patriotic Socialists"" assert that the Working class in the US is being oppressed by an ""outside force"", that being the Bourgeoisie. However, this take is close, but not completely correct. The Bourgeoisie of the United States, as the world's foremost Imperial power, are not oppressing American workers the same way they oppress the workers, of, say, Australia or Mexico. Capital is largely *imported* to the USA, not exported. The Bourgeoisie are only ""outside"" the working class, not the nation itself. Likewise, the workers out *outside* their government, which is not and never was intended to be representative of the workers, of course, it is merely the apparatus in which the Bourgeoisie conduct their operations. The answer to this, then, brings me to return to my analogy to the USSR: do as the Soviets did and build political power *outside* of the Government of the United States, until you are capable of directly challenging the American State for political dominance - upon which a revolution begins and the class war becomes a civil war. Again, I return to my old conclusion: the United States of America was founded as a Liberal-bourgeois republic and has existed as such for close to 250 years. It has run its course. The time has come for American proletarians to sweep it aside and replace the Bourgeois Republic with a Socialist one.

**5: The Question of National Self-Determination of various nations in the United States**

There are many nations and communities within the United States, many of which are vying for liberation, each of which have separate but similar grievances and demands. In Australia, most indigenous tribes and communities do not have a concept of statehood, and although the law of self-determination must be respected, it is unlikely that any new countries will emerge after an Australian revolution. In America, this is not the case, owing both to the national composition of America and its geographical components. The Indigenous peoples of Australia largely lived nomadic lives, viewing themselves as ""caretakers"" of the land rather than as owners. They maintained a complex system of crude ""international relations"" with their immediate neighbours, but that was about it^(5). Indigenous Americans, on the other hand, did form states and nations - the Iroqois Confederacy, iirc, was an inspiration for the United States Congress. Regardless, these nations were conquered by the United States. They fought bravely for their survival, but were ultimately defeated - and yet, they survive, still striving for liberation and survival today. In addition to this, there exists the question of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska. Then there comes the racial question and the division of white from black working class comrades. What is to be done?

A Rainbow Coalition. I must confess, I had not heard of such a concept until I was writing this. But regardless, the concept is the most viable so far to achieve national and economic liberation in the United States.

The reason why such a concept is not suited for Australia is because our country, for better or worse, is overwhelmingly white - around 71.1 - 89% of the population, the remainder being a mix of indian and southeast asian, with around 2.8% (\~750,000) being indigenous. In America, only 60.8% of the population is white, the remainder being a very diverse mix of african american, hispanic, asian, and so on - all of whom have a long history of being at varying levels of relations with the United States Government - seldom good. I remember reading a while ago, around the time of the George Floyd Riots, a theory work by u/theDashRendar about the dillemma of the ruling class at that time [(link to a reading I did of it)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kc0a0hnkhg), and they made a great point about how never since the Russian Revolution had there been a revolution where the agents of the state may rebel against it. I believe this parrallel works here, too. The Russian empire was also filled with hundreds of ethnic groups, each desiring their own representation - and yet, they were organised into one, united, cohesive Union - not a New Russia, but a Union of Soviets. If American revolutionaries with to maintain the territorial integrity or borders of the current United States, so be it, but the socialist republic that emerges out of it *must not* in any way reflect the empire that preceded it. And, ultimately, the law of self-determination is ultimate. Unless they're trying to form a capitalist state, of course.

In America, the National Question is answered as follows: Workers of all Colours must unite to overthrow the bourgeosie in their country. But they will not do so by mimicking the current power structure, ""traditions"" and organisation of the preexisting state. They will do so by building a united front of all races and nations, as did the Bolsheviks, to overthrow the Bourgeoisie and build in its place not a Socialist version of the United States, but a Socialist State in America. That is the task of American Communists: Smash the Capitalist US, build a Socialist America.

**Footnotes:**

1. Australia is still a British Commonwealth realm - our head of state is still Queen Elizabeth II. In 1975 the United States' CIA, in conjunction with the British Mi6, staged a ""constitutional coup"" to remove Prime Minister Gough Whitlam - officially over his minority government and use of power, unofficially over him ending Australian involvement in Vietnam, his desire to nationalise American-owned mines, to shut down the US spy base Pine Gap (which is still in operation to this day and serves as the largest American intelligence base in the Asia-Pacific Region), and to join the non-aligned movement. Luckily, we didn't share the same fate as Chile, and Whitlam was replaced with the opposition leader Malcolm Fraser who pulled significantly closer to the US out of fear they'd remove him too, famously saying: ""We are allies with the United States to protect us from the United States"".
2. Ned Kelly was an Irish-Australian ""Bushranger"", essentially an outlaw, known for leading a gang of criminals to rob banks and participate in other criminal acts involving livestock theft - however, they were very particular about it in that they wore distinct bulletproof plate armour fashioned from ploughshares, and only targeted state property, Squatters (Australian Kulaks, basically) and police officers. When they did hold up a particular site, they would destroy debt records and redistribute some of the spoils of the robbery to the people they'd inconvenienced by holding them hostage, and - and how Australian is this - they sometimes bought drinks for the men. Kelly was hanged in 1880, despite some 300,000 people (out of 850,000 in the Colony of Victoria at the time) signing a petition demanding he be set free. His last words were ""Such is life"", basically ""Eh, fuck it."" He is a controversial figure in contemporary Australia, though he and his image and what he stood for is held in high esteem by many working class Australians - even the Australian Communist Party uses his likeness. The bourgeois state apparatus condemns him as a criminal, but he is undoubtedly an Australian worker's hero.
3. ""Coolie"" is a colloquial term to refer to indentured labour that were essentially slaves captured from other British colonies in the indo-pacific area. Some were Chinese, though a majority were from India, Bengal, Myanmar and the Pacific Islands. Though not officially slaves, they were effectively slaves.
4. The Eureka Stockade was a labour rebellion in Ballarat, British Colony of Victoria (Now the Australian State) in December 1854 - January 1855. Striking miners staged an armed rebellion in the goldfields there (this was during the Australian Gold Rush), protesting low payments for mined gold, high mining taxes, no democratic representation, police brutality and discrimination. Though the original 5,000 at Eureka were defeated, the crown was forced to concede to *all* of the Miner's demands a month later in January 1855, when a crowd three times the size of the original rebellion rallied.
5. Indigenous Australians numbered around \~200 or so ""nations"" across the Australian continent, Tasmania and the Torres Strait Islands. Each one had its own customs, language, culture and so on; vague, loosely defined borders and a loosely similar set of policies regarding interacting with neighbouring tribes. Each tribe, for instance, had a ""Totem"", such as an animal they would not hunt - out of respect, neighbouring tribes would also not hunt such an animal. There were, of course, scuffles and conflicts between various tribes, but none that resulted in the outright conquest of one tribe by another. Though they lived largely nomadic lives, there is evidence they engaged in Farming, and had a basic understanding of ecology, as did Indigenous Americans.",2021-11-05 09:38:19,89

The rap I listened reflects many different opinions. I will put here quotes to show what I mean. Obviously rap is usually leftist, or rap de co√±a neoliberal, so I only was exposed to that.

Especially this song I‚Äôm trying to understand: [Aberria / Patria / P√†tria](https://youtu.be/O47w1fN-Qdw)

- I don‚Äôt remeber exactly who said this but I think it was the leftist band Sons of Aguirre: ‚Äúon my balcony I don‚Äôt hang a flag, I hang the boss‚Äù.
- Also Sons of Aguirre: ‚ÄúNo es verdad, mi angel de amor, que en este apartado estado nadie organiza al proletariado, y se explota mejor?‚Äù

- In the Catalan anarchist song ‚ÄúLa nostra sentencia‚Äù by Adala they criticize the 1-O but then they also say ‚ÄúPer√≤ no tots pensem igual, uns crear un Estat no ens mou. No lluitem contra un imperi per crear-ne un de nou‚Äù, soooo‚Ä¶? What then?

- And in the Galician / Basque / Catalan / Aragonese song ‚ÄúAberria / Patria / P√†tria‚Äù they criticize the imperialism of the state but they also seem to talk about how their nationalist parties sell out or something: ‚ÄúTornem a fer una performance? Podem somiar que som lliures /  o teixir comunitat, embat a l‚Äôestat des dels barris on hem de conviure‚Äù and ‚ÄúCatalunya i el seu doble joc; Hem passat d‚Äôocupar-lo a ampliar l‚Äôaeroport.

And then the Aragonese says (shitty translation) ‚ÄúA mi no me enga√±an. S√© quien es el enimigo. Aquesta p√†tria que imposen amb la puta bandera nos esconde un castigo‚Äù

And then the Basque says ‚ÄúPoco de rojo, mucho de blanco, es el verde el color del puto Pais Basco $$$  Eskerrik asko.‚Äù

305,qz9125,MeikooMeiko,Islam justifies Arabic nationalism,"What I think is particularly disturbing is the heavily Arabcentric view instilled in muslims, which I am not sure is mandated by Islamic writings, but is certainly encouraged by the general tone. Last week a Muslim Redditor told me most Muslims give their children Arabic names because Arabic is the language God favored to communicate with humankind (hmm, probably nothing to do with the fact his prophet Muhammad was Arabian and could only communicate fluently in it, right?), and the Arabic names are ‚Äî don't ask me exactly how, his words ‚Äî ‚Äúespecially blessed by God and have a deeper meaning than the names of other cultures"". Of course, that's all an extremely ethnocentric bias disguised under a seemingly religious speech.

There are also other issues. If a religion values modesty in clothing (and Christianity historically recommended it, too, even if not so strictly nor so specifically, particularly because what is modest in, say, the Amazon jungles may not be modest in cold continental Russia), then why does it have to be so detailed and specific, coincidentally in such a way that fits the expectations, tasted and cultural patterns of medieval Arabians? Can't one be modest using an endless gamut of different clothes and garments? Why would a supreme God care about what specific clothes I wear, caring more about the appearance than about the broader and core principle?

I am not saying Islam HAS TO BE like that, but I just know that the truth is that it is taught and practiced that way by/for most Muslims today. It's almost like the unsaid rule is ‚Äúto be a good Muslim, be as Arab-like as possible"". No other big religion does that acculturation as intensely, unless they are an ETHNIC, not a purportedly universal religion.

In that sense, when I read about the endless and hyper-detailed rules meant for Muslims' behavior, living and appearance, I often get the impression that it is one of those ancient religions in which there was a very muddled and almost merged relationship between religion, tradition, culture, law and way of life. The religion was directly tied to one's ethnic identity and cultural sense of belonging.

That's fine for me, but a universal religion proposing that a supreme and totally abstract and immaterial God cares a lot about such superficial cultural differences, impose (or at least recommend) such purposeless behavioral norms such as growing a beard or wearing a headdress in such and such way? I don't know, but I don't find it convincing nor rational at all.",2021-11-21 18:53:21,31

309,qma3uv,TheRealColonelAutumn,Thoughts of the idea Patriotic Nationalism in the United States [Also Essay Flair Please],"Recently there has been much discussion among the online left about nationalism, patriotism and it‚Äôs place in leftwing politics, in particular that of the United States.  Self Described Leftwing Patriots have come up arguing that the 21st Century Left‚Äôs opposition and or reluctance to embrace patriotism and or nationalism weakens them and makes left wing ideologies less appealing to the people that it is supposed to appeal to, ie the working class. I have a couple questions regarding the issue at hand for the advocates of it.

The First being which attributes of a respective country (such as the United States) should a left wing movement be proud of? The history of the Left in the United States has been a history of people fighting in opposition to it. John Brown is a symbol often celebrated by those on the online left, but his story ended with his arrest and execution by US Soldiers by the US Government. Many of those who came before us in the United States, were arrested, beaten, shot, tried, and executed by their own nation, a nation that until recently was strict on who was seen as acceptable members of society. I ask what should a self described leftist be proud of toward a nation that has held nothing but scorn for him and his ilk since the thoughts of Marx first came to paper. 

The second being if attempting to embrace patriotism would be effective in convincing a people who have for decades been feed propaganda claiming left wing activism and ideology as unpatriotic?

The third being why would a nation that can only currently survive off the exploitation of the third world wish to turn against it‚Äôs own interest?

These are questions that must at some point be answered by Left Wing Patriots, and I hope to see their answer as time goes on.",2021-11-03 20:56:21,49
310,r0ebyx,hillenium,Racism and Nationalism: How They Divide the Ummah,"A lot of us are very quick to identify and respond to nationalism, particularly when it becomes racism. We don‚Äôt hesitate to call out the white nationalist or the KKK as we should, but oftentimes we turn a blind eye when some of us Muslims do it to ‚Äúother‚Äù races or ethnicities. The very idea that we should establish countries based on race and/or ethnicity is historically new and is problematic in many ways. It will inevitably lead to unjust wars and sometimes gHaqiqaMy thoughts on that have developed after a recent trip to Istanbul. I was struck by the glorious mosques and hearing the¬†adhan¬†echoing beautifully throughout the city. My¬†fitrah¬†compelled me to rush to the nearest mosque to worship Allah SWT. Living in a non-Muslim country, over time, you might stop realizing the importance of these spiritual practices, the effect they have on your contentment. How the absence of it can slowly erode your¬†iman¬†and corrupt your¬†fitrah.

This brings me to my main point: despite still being visibly religious, Istanbul overwhelmed me with the nationalism I experienced throughout the city. The amount of Atat√ºrk pictures and flags with his face I saw were blinding. Even shopkeepers with hijab or otherwise ‚ÄúMuslim‚Äù looking attire were proudly showcasing the TƒÅgh≈´t who fought to take away the very rights they enjoy as believers. The propaganda of secularism was shockingly obvious.

What puzzled me the most was that people who were otherwise very friendly at the beginning of our interaction changed their whole demeanor after they found out I was Kurdish. Some laughed sarcastically as if the name of my ethnicity was a joke of some sort, others froze for a second and continued by ignoring me, not responding to me as if I was not even there from that moment on, and switched to conversing only with my wife who isn‚Äôt Kurdish.

This might come across as just personal, but the situations I encountered are more than that. Nationalistic ideas are rooted in many predominantly Islamic countries, not only in the West as many of us presume.

I want to highlight the fact that I am simply using Turkey as an example here. Obviously, most Turkish people are not racist, Alhamdulillah!

We Muslims are meant to be one Ummah. And we are, for the most part. However, the growing monster of racist nationalism throughout the ummah has been dividing already weakened unity. Turkey is one of many examples of such events, where the tactics of the Kuffar have succeeded to a certain extent to divide and conquer the Muslims. As each day passes, the Muslims are encouraged to accept the fact that we don‚Äôt have a proper Islamic country or Khilafah. They want us to not even aspire for it, rather to just accept this status quo.

‚ÄúO mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Aware.‚Äù ‚Äî The Holy Qur‚Äôan 49:13.

I notice that extreme liberalism seems to be a problem on every continent. Extreme liberalism = extreme openness and tolerance. Extreme openness = eventually becoming a push over. When you let foreigners into your nation, then become extremely liberal and accepting of them, this leads to them taking over your homeland and eroding your culture. This happened with Africans letting in Europeans. Happened with the Americans letting in the French, British and Spanish. Is happening now with the Caribbeans letting in the Americans, Chinese and Russians. Happening in European countries with them letting in Africans, Central Asians and Arabs....

So why can't we all be mature and agree that each race shall be supreme on their home continent? 

And for those that live in a nation, culture or continent, if they prefer other nations and cultures(radical liberals), instead of trying to change their homeland, why not just move to other lands and assimilate to the other cultures they worship?

317,r1bfoj,fleker2,Pokemon X & Y are about nationalism,"Quite a number of people dislike the X & Y games. Though a fan of mega evolutions, the story behind them and the interactions with Team Flare seem to be regarded poorly.

It seems like a lot of people just don't understand what the story was about, or the underlying message of the games.

In the past few decades there has been a political phenomenon generally referred to as [democratic backsliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding) where an executive will erode democratic or constitutional freedoms, often under the guise of appealing to nationalism or populism.

The rise of deadly terrorism and economic ruin at the start of the 2010s led many to seek stronger leaders and a desire to look at the past through rose-colored glasses. Anything and everything new was scapegoated. Politicians campaigned on blame rather than solutions.

This brings us to the conditions under which Pokemon X & Y were developed, which were released in 2013.

Team Flare are a group of nationalist terrorists and the dialogue in the game highlights and critiques their populist message.

Lysandre, like many populist leaders, comes from a background of wealth and privilege. As a business leader, he is used to a strict hierarchy and has an aggrandized ego. He uses modern media outlets to promote his message to others. He looks at the ugliness of the modern world and laments it, as many people do.

>*Listen well. Team Flare will revive the ultimate weapon, eliminate everyone who isn't in our group, and return the world to a beautiful, natural state. Unproductive fools are consuming our future... If nothing changes, the world will become ugly and conflicts will raze the land from end to end.*

Yet rather than try to fix the problems of the day, he decides that the problem is modernity itself, that nothing can be fixed. The problem is the ""other"", those minorities and the poor who nationalist leaders can easily pin blame upon, for few are willing to stand up for them. Complaining about the lazy, ""unproductive"" people not ""in our group"" is directly out of nationalist speeches.

His solutions come from freezing the world in its current state, after getting rid of all the ""unproductive fools"". It's not about improving, but ""returning"" to beauty.

>*Lysandre: ""You played a young girl so wonderfully in your debut on the silver screen. Wouldn't you rather remain young and beautiful forever and always play such roles?""""You were chosen to be a movie star, correct? Isn't it your duty to be ever beautiful? Everything beautiful should stay that way forever. I would make this world unchanging and eternal so all beauty will last forever.*[***X***](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y)*/I would end the world in an instant so that beauty never fades.*[***Y***](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y) *I can't stand the thought of the world becoming uglier.""*  
>  
>*Diantha: ""What a strange question... Why would I want to play the same old roles forever? Youth may be beautiful, but it's not all there is to life. Everything changes. I want to live and change like that, too. So I look forward to playing different roles as I get older.""*

Lysandre's message is rejected by Diantha, but their exchange at the start of the game highlights his regret about the changing world. While it specifically is about fleeting youth, later statements shows his larger intentions.

Later, in Lysandre's cafe, he talks a bit about his personal lineage. Appeals to history and trying to inject themselves into the canon of the nation are tendencies of nationalists. It's another way to promote oneself over others who aren't ""real"" people of Kalos.

>*I'm a descendant of the king's younger brother. That being said, that story is 3,000 years old, so it might not be entirely reliable.*

As you continue to interact with him over your journey, his violent desires become more apparent.

>*Professor Sycamore told me you can now wield Mega Evolution. That is truly wonderful. With that power, you can steer your future in a better direction! We can't just cover up the old filth with new filth! I implore you to consider what we need to do to change the world into a new, beautiful world!*

His ultimate intention is to immortalize those people he has selected while letting the rest of the world die. To nationalists and populists, this is their final goal. Eliminating all the ""filth"" and ""unproductive"" people, you end up with a pure culture and a pure race. They imagine that once this is achieved their nation will achieve some sort of harmony.

Xerneas and Yvetal are the legendary Pokemon that can grant life and death respectively. Using these powers selectively one can create a static society, never changing, and eliminating any dissent.

Of course it's a false promise. People cannot be so neatly labeled, and genocide is barbaric. These leaders maintain power by passing blame on to new demons. It's always the fault of others, and their elimination is the only way to solve it.

The way to grow as a society, a culture, and a person are to actively seek out new ideas and learn from the expertise of others. This is the philosophy of a democratic society, or more specifically the liberal democracy of the post-WW2 era. Professor Sycamore says:

>*Now listen. If you visit many different places to complete the Pok√©dex, you will probably see Pok√©mon with many ways of living and meet people with many ways of thinking. First, accept the ways of living and thinking that sometimes conflict with your own. And think about what's really important--this will truly broaden your horizons.*

The rise of democratic backsliding has continued in many countries. While it is easier to blame others, the game's message is to not fear the other. Change is inevitable and we should accept other people with other ideas and philosophies. Certainly not those ideas that lead to the violence terror of Team Flare, but those ideas that give us a more enlightening view of the world.

As I really looked at the game's story and characters, I found the game's message to be one of the more interesting and yet least discussed.",2021-11-24 12:14:54,30

Question inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKXtv2_IaCY&lc=Ugg8HKaI65g04HgCoAEC.8APGW-_2uaw9QBoXquajp1) YouTube comment:

""\[Kelsey Grammer's\] version is ok, nothing more. He sings it well, but it doesn't work with the context of the song. I encourage you to actually watch some proper performances of G&S, they are exceptional.  G&S were satirists. Their plays were satire. The message of ""For he is an Englishman"" isn't English patriotism. The message is that being an Englishman and being a good man aren't the same thing. The song is a satirical piece poking fun at the contemporary nationalistic sentiments which conflated those two things. Whether Ralph is suitable to marry Josephine has nothing to do with whether he's English or not.  Any performance which presents ""For he is an Englishman"" as an actual nationalistic ode to England is completely misunderstanding what the song is about.  It's satire. G&S wrote satire.""

Is this true? When I listen, I hear a song bursting with national pride. ""For he himself has said it, And it's greatly to his credit, That he is an Englishman!"". I personally don't read any sarcasm or satire in this line. The lyrics, of course, contain satire, but in my reading the satire boosts the message of English nationalism: ""But in spite of all temptations, to belong to other nations, he remains a Englishman"" - the joke, to me, being that there are few temptations to belong to any other nation. Am I wrong?

That there would be a nationalist overtones in this play agrees with my (very limited) knowledge that the period of the late 1800's in Europe coincided with generally high nationalistic sentiments (unless I am wrong here). 

However, satire is really all about context, and I admit that I really don't know a lot about the historical context in which this play was released, and, well, I haven't even seen the entire play. So, at the risk of asking a very simple question if I were to just watch the whole thing, is the song ""He is a Englishman"" from Gilbert and Sullivans' Pinafore celebrating or satirizing English nationalism?",2021-11-09 07:36:35,33

365,q0hopq,MLCifaretto,Defeatist Nationalism," Anyone who is familiar with the work done by the MAC  or even with my work is wise to the fact that we have nothing but contempt for those living in the west who erroneously refer to themselves as communist and their social fascism as communism. At times, the expression of this contempt can be so vitriolic that it conveys the feeling that we do not believe that any serious, principled Marxist-Leninists can exist within the imperial core. This, however, is not true. We do maintain that it is highly unlikely for someone to enjoy the standard of living afforded to them in the west, be part of the labor aristocracy as a result and still be sincere in saying that they are Marxist-Leninist. While it is highly unlikely, it‚Äôs by no means impossible. If one living in the imperial core is a serious Marxist-Leninist in spite of their class interests, it would make them an anomaly.

This extends to anyone who is a labor aristocrat, is wise to their class‚Äôs parasitism and aligns with the proletariat and anti-imperialist forces against the labor aristocracy and contemporary regime. Needless to say, this description does apply to the majority of us here and I would suggest attempting to be as helpful and supportive as possible in helping along those who wish to fight imperialism at its core. With that said, if you plan to approach someone like this, they would need to already be an anomaly and follow a kind of defeatist nationalism in the first place. They are few and far between and are constantly being goaded into supporting rainbow imperialism, social fascism and rootless cosmopolitanism by the ‚Äúleftists‚Äù they encounter at home.

![img](68px16q8h8r71 "" Krokodil 1927, drawing by Iulii Ganf.
\""A writer decided to gather material for a novel from real life. He went to a worker's club and this is what he saw ( left) and this is how he imagined it in his own work ( right) "")

The point of laying all this out is to emphasize that while these people may feel dedicated to fighting imperialism and even have the right ideological inclination, they are in the minority and by default, are going to have to make great compromises in fulfilling the ultimate goal of defeating finance imperialism. While in countries like the US, it may be impossible for them to rally the people under the banner of communism, there are still elements that share the common ground found in defeatist nationalism. Before anyone wants to blame the lack of popularity of actual socialism in the US on ‚Äúfalse consciousness‚Äù and propaganda, we ought to point out the relationship of the majority of people in the US to imperialism and what would be necessary for them to support socialism. Anyone who tells you that there is a sizable proletariat in a country within the imperial core is a liar and that is clear the moment one takes the time to scale the labor performed by the country‚Äôs people and the extent to which they‚Äôre compensated. 

In every country in the imperial core, the imperialists have gone through great effort to elevate ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù class unproductives or labor aristocracy at the expense of the proletariat of imperialized countries. There is little industrial production that is not done automatically, damn near nobody is working in mines to obtain natural resources since they too are stolen alongside the labor from imperialized countries. Despite the lack of labor in comparison to countries in the global south, those in the west are vastly overcompensated and have immense spending power. If you are right in saying the labor aristocrat benefits from imperialism far less than the petty bourgeoisie or bourgeoisie and he realizes it, his response will not be to turn against imperialism, but rather to demand that he receive a larger portion of the proceeds. Their material interests are inextricably tied to imperialism and more often than not, the continued existence and prosperity of their whole profession necessarily requires the exploitation of both earth and labor. However, loathe as all of us may be to say, they constitute the majority class in imperialist countries which means that we cannot speak about class warfare or liberation if catering our message to them. Alternatively, we cannot be like the hyperliberal ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùcommunist‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù parties in the west who inadvertently support the left flank of imperialism as they advocate for this unproductive, parasitic majority.

Building class solidarity among them would make the overall circumstances worse for the proletariat in the global south, but emphasizing nationalism to these types would ultimately serve our cause. Many claiming to be communists in the west have failed to acknowledge this, so I must point it out. The enemy of your enemy is your friend. It should be apparent that I‚Äôm not encouraging you comrades in the imperial core to garner communist support. For that matter, it‚Äôs more than likely that the people you‚Äôll be forced to deal with are reprehensible and distasteful in the things that they stand for, but when dealing with imperialists, the one thing you must avoid like the plague is ultra-leftism. You will not have allies who speak for the working class or even against imperialism for that matter. If you‚Äôre in a country whose majority have been greatly benefited from imperialism, to advocate self-sufficiency, industrialization and proletarization, let alone communism is to ask them to permanently lower their standard of living in the long term and face abject poverty in the interim. 

Granted, our goal IS to encourage class suicide and it would be more than optimal if such an approach could come to fruition. Sadly, they are not the aforementioned anomalies and would need to choose to go against the present imperialist order for their own reasons on their own terms. Our cause cannot offer the patriotic people of any western country greater comfort or compensation because that would be very obviously deceitful, but it can offer these people the prospect of national self-determination and autonomy. It is in our best interests to help these types of people find material goals which supersede the benefits they receive from parasitism. More often than not, this entails teaching them about national self-determination and then making them realize that rootless cosmopolitanism and neoliberalism in general will cause the full decay of their people who we already know they hold dear.

The only way you could make these people reject what is materially convenient and beneficial for them is if you can show them that the cost is their people‚Äôs continued existence. If you can‚Äôt tell them to commit class suicide for material gain, you can at least show them that to maintain national characteristics and to keep in place the things that make their people, their people, it would be necessary for them to secede and/or topple the present pro-imperialist regime. Aside from that, I must reiterate that the enemy of our enemy is our friend and between us serious Marxist-Leninists and sincere nationalists, there is nothing but bitterness and abhorrence when we think of the practices and consequences of consumerism in general and neoliberalism in particular. Even with the near complete liquidation of the proletariat in countries within the imperial core, the proletariat are still the foundation of any nation. It is at that point that you can piece together that the nationalists you should implore to join you have at least minimal proletarian characteristics. While they may not be or have been proletarian, it is very likely that they too, have good reason to want industrialization in the wake of neoliberal rot. We can use the US as an example of a country that had great industry at a point in the cities that formed the rust belt. Prior to neoliberalism, cities such as Pittsburgh, Detroit, Paterson, Newark, Cleveland, etc. were built by the working class and were quite prosperous. In the wake of outsourcing and the US plundering the global south on an even grander scale, these cities became absolutely desolate. Any nationalist for any of the nations in the US would be wise to this fact if they have even a little proletarian character and will push, first and foremost for the reintroduction of industry in their own countries.

These people can be set against the greater labor aristocracy which ultimately stands to maintain and run the apparatus of the imperialists. It is possible to make someone feel the complete decay of the rust belt in their heart and take it very personally. They can be made to understand that for google, tinder, onlyfans, facebook, etc. to be prosperous, the productive forces and also industry must be near non-existent due to neoliberalism imposing obsolescence upon the proletariat. In addition, these are the kinds of people who also realize that immigration en-masse as the liberals want is entirely against the interests of the worker. Immigration in its current form is a tool employed by the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie to cheapen labor by means of underbidding. Instead of complaining that workers do not take too kindly to their professions, nations and cultures being eroded, we should show sympathy. Literally anyone can be made to understand that absent the meddling of the neo-colonialists whether by war or by finance, immigration is no longer an issue as those previously suffering due to imperialism would have little reason to immigrate and as such, the working class would not need to worry about the cheapening of their labor. 

All of this is before we even touch upon the cultural and moral decay that is ever-present among the liberal cosmopolitan bourgeoisie as well as anyone who supports them. In order to justify the rabid finance imperialism that the west imposes upon other countries, they must cultivate consumerism to ensure that there is an ever-rising demand for commodities. Economic understanding and analysis notwithstanding, the commodity is the focus of your entire life and it is only this way because the monopolists must garner support for their widespread theft and extortion. I remember writing an article about how Palestinian homes were being demolished by settlers in the name of creating a theme park...For a motherfucking theme park.

I remember not being able to believe the absurdity and the sheer indecency of such actions. It should not surprise anyone, anywhere that one can easily conflate this scenario with the actions of neoliberal forces in general. Moral injustices aside, this rot affects everything it touches. Everything must be commodified under neoliberalism and they truly do believe in creating whole ‚Äúindustries‚Äù with the core philosophy of consumption for its own sake. To line their pockets, the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie will push for widespread drug use, push for the commodification of the body under the pretense of ‚Äúliberating‚Äù prostitutes, manufacture and enforce mental illnesses for the sake of peddling pharmaceuticals, all for the sake of greater consumption and greater profit. Though the nationalist of an imperialist nation may be a parasite, he can be shown that everything and everyone he holds dear will die painfully and unceremoniously should he not align against neoliberalism.

Some of you may have the admittedly valid concern that the nationalists I implore you to approach may be inclined to be imperialist themselves. While it may be possible or even likely in some scenarios that this may come to pass, the key point is that they would still be weaker imperialists and would be at odds with the stronger imperialist entities. Infighting within the imperialist bloc is undoubtedly good for us and we should always default to a position of support for the weaker imperialists who are less of a threat. Afterwards, should they become a concern, they will be easier to tend to. Simply put, the patriotic and nationalistic elements are absolutely essential in garnering popular support which is essential in establishing socialism and maintaining power in general. They will not agree to lowering their standard of living, reindustrializing their countries and having to be self-sufficient after years of parasitism as a rule. However, they will agree to all of those things and even more if shown that it‚Äôs required in the survival of their people and to uphold human decency. Without mincing any words, there is absolutely nothing lower than the morally degenerate imperialist liberals and to oppose their lunacy means to stand with the people.

Again, comrades over there, take the lesson from your own experience. Not only did you not grudge, but you gloried in the promotion of the great generals who gained their promotion by leading their army to victory. So it is with us. We grudge no man a fortune in civil life if it is honorably obtained and well used. It is not even enough that it should have been gained without doing damage to the community. We should permit it to be gained only so long as the gaining represents benefit to the community. This, I know, implies a policy of a far more active governmental interference with social and economic conditions in this country than we have yet had, but I think we have got to face the fact that such an increase in governmental control is now necessary.

While embracing it, he also says that nationalism is bad and it's his job to pull people back from ethnic nationalism or 4chan memes. This is bad in my opinion as its always been a goal of elites to crush nationalists and divide with Mass immigration. Im not a racist, I appreciate the uniqueness of every culture. Thats why Im against the mass immigration especially to the UK, Sweden and France. I was in Paris 12 years ago and was shocked at how little French there were.

1) He completely misunderstands the concept of pride, even a quick look at the dictionary definition shows he's wrong, "" a feeling or deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own achievements, the achievements of those with whom one is closely associated, or from qualities or possessions that are widely admired."" I mean, what he's saying here is completely inhuman. He's attacking European pride like it's some kind of sin, ironically like SJWs. He also disregards Europeans culture as possibly Middle Eastern instead? If you compare this to Jewish culture, which literally has a state, Peterson has no such criticisms.

2) This ad hominen he's constructing to use against Nationalists is so pathetic. As I've already said, pride can be felt towards a group that one is a part of; Peterson is at odds pretending it's not. But more importantly, all he's doing is trying to get out of debating right-wingers which he has already proven he won't do, and will use his power to suppress the voice of right-wingers (like Faith Goldy) if they step out of the mainstream rights orthodoxy.

Our clothes, shoes, and phones are produced by sweatshop workers in the underdeveloped world precisely because these regions have more relaxed labor laws. If you don't want goods produced under these conditions, you should support economic nationalism, as this would allow us some ability to regulate the conditions that workers producing these goods work under.

Some may say we should produce goods in other nations, but only if those nations agree to our standards. Even *if*  we made other nations agree to work under our labor laws, there would be no way for us to enforce these standards without violating that nation's sovereignty. The only way to ensure that our goods are produced under standards we are okay with is to have those goods produced under our jurisdiction, that is, within our country. It is simply much easier to enforce labour laws in our own nation that is to enforce them on other nations.",2021-11-09 00:55:47,0

I can understand stuff like black nationalism or pan-indian (American Indian) becaseu the forceful removal from places can kinda destroy roots to a certain place, so having a shared connection through  stuff like skin color in a second class dispora I can understand. And I could even understand Chinese nationalism at first...over 60 years ago. The century of humiliation had ended and they needed to stand up to imperialist powers.

But in my experience left wing nationalism is 1. Its Temporary  and after a full sense of ide tidy as been achieved you no longer use race..at least not in the same way as before. 2. Only when your oppressed. And I don't think China can be called externally oppressed when it's a rising superpower (If not one already) and has a  decent standard of living (I could be wrong I'd need more info). In a way people who are pro china tend to make that same logical inconsistency that facists have made. Where the enemy (America in this case but in a way china too) is both weak...and yet the greatest threat to it.

The thought occurred to me that Aristotelian philosophy and Christian theology provides valid answers to this question, while most of the Japanese today are bereft of both, living amid secularist materialism. Philosophy is important, especially when creating content children are watching.

Christianity provides multiple answers to this question, as Brian Davies explores in his book *The Reality of God and the Problem of Suffering*, which Ed Feser cites in his *The Last Superstition*. However, many Japanese still have the view that Christianity is a religion for foreigners; since they are taught to conform and decide what is best for the group, please pray for an increase in Japanese priests and Japanese parishioners, so that they may finally meet a 'critical threshold' of native Japanese practitioners to stop viewing Christianity as a foreigner's religion.",2021-10-12 14:02:56,70

The  book contains lectures given by the author at Mysore university.  thus it is rather crisp, to the point and easy to read. While  the title may sound controversial in the current political climate of  India. The book is rather a rebuttal to the western (Britishers in this  case as these lectures were given in 1920) notion that Indian  civilization had no national identity and the culture was more focused  on the afterlife, philosophy (meditation, several schools of thoughts  that have existed and continue to exist in modern India) than the  practical questions at the hand like doing practical sciences that could  be used to improve living standards, a sense of national identity that  is important for a collective nation/ society to develop as opposed to  individual growth.   


The author argues that in oldest of the  Indian texts there was several mentions of India as a collective  identity, a praise for flaura and fauna that inhibits its land, the  Sanskrit isn't just merely a language for philosophical conversation but  had more practical, artistic content written in it, language, grammar  were improved. The pilgrimage sites spread across the Indian  subcontinent was the best way to educate individuals of the vast  geography of the subcontinent and consider even the far away land to be  sacred.   


The book can be read in 2-3 hours max and would highly  recommend to an Indian regardless of their political leaning or religious background.",2021-11-14 05:36:31,11

On the one extreme, we have the concept of the ethno-nation, which specifies a racial component to the above definition. One problem is that the idea of an ethno-nation is the inherently contingent and fleeting sense of community created by ethnic ties, for every nation was settled by numerous peoples of one group or another, and yet even those homogeneous nations are not any more cohesive than those ethnically heterogeneous ones. Furthermore, it is also a deplorable concept that only fosters scientific racism and pride.

But also, I dislike the concept of the nation that defines it on purely civic grounds by appealing to shared political systems. A shared goal of the common good is something that belongs to the body politic, and not to the nation. In some narrow sense, this is a part of our definition, but only on the sense that there is a shared *conception* of what constitutes this common good and not a shared aim of the common good.

One can say that if the ethno-nation was too restrictive, the civic nation is too inclusive. One excludes too many people who would otherwise rightfully belong to a nation, while the other includes many who do not have any meaningful claim to nationhood. Race, being arbitrary and unnecessary, like class, is quickly forgotten, while the full moral connotations of national identity are ignored when a common conception of history, values, culture and lineage of familial traditions are excluded.",2021-11-22 20:29:30,8

If your country doesn't have a united identity, then things start to fall apart, and countrymen start to fight with one another rather than fighting side-by-side to support each other. For this reason, socialism, which highlights a need for working class solidarity, benefits from a nationalist and patriotic component. Even ignoring all this, having a common national identity to unite around is much better than the western consumerist mentality which creates manufactured social identities.

481,r271qa,Napalm_and_Kids,"Styles of Christian Nationalism: a general comparison of BPF and Nicholas J. Fuentes and their respective ideologies, rhetorical styles, and communities","There is an interesting distinction that can be seen within the Christian flavor of far right internet group, decently illustrated by looking at and comparing BPF and Nick Fuentes.

On the one hand you have BPF's more serious style of political arguing and debate focusing on Christian nationalism - a blend of American nationalism, biblical law and vague appeals to theocracy - where being white is more a happy coincidence than a necessity. His fans probably come more from the religious and philosophy debate sphere.

On the other hand you have Fuentes and his very online edgelord brand of white supremacy with the aesthetics of Christianity added on top. Fuentes will lean into the memes, will joke and dogwhistle a lot more, and will generally be more toxic. Fuentes fans probably tend to be more typical online white supremacists, albeit ones who identify with the Christian label.

Most of what they actually want aligns, the only real difference being found in the distinction between supremacist and nationalist. very broadly speaking, white supremacy is just white nationalism with an injection of hard racism. BPF recognizes that the supremacist vein of white nationalism is costing them political power, especially as the America First movement grows and gets mainstream republican and democrat attention, and so he rejects the overtly racist dogma as well as the edgelord aesthetics, memes, and antisemitism that is found in Fuentes style groups, all of which are pretty typical of white nationalist/supremacist circles online.

In the Politically Provoked show we saw a [glimpse](https://twitter.com/PProvoked/status/1421397359007735811?s=20) of the infighting between these broad camps. BPF was fighting to keep out the more numerous Groyper kids who were flooding in, and ultimately he lost due to Brittany siding with the more profitable Groypers and the combination of trolls, neo-nazis, and racists that tend to follow along. It's important to qualify here that BPF doesn't particularly disagree with the racist, antisemitic groups, they are close allies at the end of the day, but he *does* think they aren't as effective politically, and if he can get them to shut the fuck up, he can argue their positions in a much better way. Kind of like Destiny and his frustration with the progressives who end up making caricatures of themselves and their positions due to bad arguments and thinking.

BPF is probably more of a political threat because of how his style and opinion overlaps with the more hardline Christian conservatives, but Fuentes is the more vitriolic and obviously dangerous ideologue because of his flirting with more explicit racism and antisemitism. Currently, in America, Evangelical boomers are going to agree with BPF's more biblical, and on the face of it Christian, kind of American nationalism, while the younger online edgelords will find Fuentes more appealing due to his edgier race based positions and memetics.

I was on Quora and I came across this answer saying and potraying how nationalism is bad

As you guys are more knowledgeable than me, I want you guys to dismantle and if possible find the faults in this answer and expose this answer completely point by point

HIS ANSWER:

""***T******here has long been a brouhaha over the difference between nationalism and patriotism. While the liberals argue that it a menace for an inclusive society, the conservative right wing cadre deems it as an imperative integrating force.***

***Nationalism in my view is a parochial concept that doesn‚Äôt just preach about taking pride in one‚Äôs ethnic identity but also to have a sense of superiority over others. While the former is completely normal the latter is what disturbs the liberals because that sense of superiority consequently develops into acrimony towards other creeds,ethnicities, cultures etc and thus one can infer that nationalism emanates from xenophobia and racial prejudice. Geoff Mulgan very aptly put this into words stating that ‚ÄúAll of nationalism can be understood as a kind of collective narcissism‚Äù.***

***Nationalism, furthermore, classifies people in two groups namely nationalists and anti-nationalists, and anyone who doesn‚Äôt conform to that yardstick is called an anti-nationalist***

***Nationalism in India under BJP.***

***As I am an Indian I can speak about nationalism in Indian context and most importantly under BJP \[ the right wing political party which is in power right now\]. As I have closely seen the vicious nature of nationalism under this regime I can delineate it through the example of this government.***

***In the last 5 years, debate has been reduced to whataboutery, dissent has been dubbed treason and jingoism has become the new nationalism.***

***The nationalism that BJP- RSS endorse is a distorted and rather noxious version of patriotism to woo the voters by exploiting their sentiments which is further promulgated by the mainstream media to entrench that into the subconscious of Hindus specifically in Indian context. BJP has somehow ably indoctrinated the masses with vitriol and lately this has been palpable in the society.***

***Nationalism in India is often viewed with a Hindu perspective which is evident from the recent occurrences where Naseeruddin Shah was dubbed an anti-national for expressing his concern over the hatred spread in society following the gruesome incidents of Mob lynching‚Äôs, but when the Hindu nationalists carp ‚ÄúHindu Khatre me hai‚Äù they are hailed as nationalists. This hypocrisy is often glossed over by the mainstream media who tend to abhor the so called ‚Äúselective outrage‚Äù by the left liberals.***

***Changing definition of nationalism.***

***What fazes me even more is that the idea of nationalism is getting even more blinkered with the passage of time. While BJP from the very beginning has made it clear that anyone who refuses to chant ‚ÄúVande Mataram‚Äù is an anti-national and obviously loathing Pakistan is tantamount to loving India, Subramanium Swamy a few years earlier said that anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree that Hindus were there ancestors are anti nationals and today anyone who stands for the languishing Kashmiri‚Äôs and highlights their plight is pronounced an anti-national because they believe that all this being done in national interest, recent example of it was Kannan Gopinathan, an IAS officer who resigned from his post protesting against the arbitrary clampdown in Kashmir. So the yardstick of nationalism has been getting narrower with time and it won‚Äôt take me by surprise if a few years later only a particular creed will fit into the requited measure of Indian nationalism.***

***What kind of national interest is it where consent of the people of the nation is not considered?***

***What kind of integrating force is this which assails the syncretic ethos of the world‚Äôs largest democracy?***

***What sort of notion is nationalism where a student who crusades against the atrocities of government is deemed as an anti-national but the assassin of the father of the nation is thought of as a nationalist?***

***How is Patriotism different?***

***Patriotism on the other hand doesn‚Äôt dictate one‚Äôs ideology or coerces someone to abide by any nationalist rule book. A patriot can love other nations like one‚Äôs own and still not be declared a threat to his nation. A patriot does not have to prove his allegiance towards a nation by chanting slogans for the sake of it. A patriot does not validate someone else‚Äôs allegiance towards the nation. A patriot serves the nation to make it greater rather than being complacent and convincing oneself that the nation they live in is the greatest.***

***Nationalism played a salient role in the Indian freedom struggle but remember that the actions of freedom fighters were not driven by animosity towards the Britishers but their despotic regime***.**""**
