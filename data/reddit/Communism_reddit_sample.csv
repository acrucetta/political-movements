No, there's absolutely tons of us here and that's kind of the point.

This sub is unapologetically anti-capitalist and would be excited to see it's downfall. 

The current concept of ""work"", basically shit wages given to you under coercive violence (starvation, homelessness etc)  to produce capital to feed the ever growing maw of the owning class, needs to be dismantled.

It's is the only way to fully see permanent change and change labor into what it was always meant to be, fulfilling and society improving and only a small portion of your life.",2021-10-27 07:32:07,6266

The old man turns to one of them and says, ""Dimitri, remember in 1921 you were almost executed? Well, you should know that I ratted you out to the Cheka. I hope you forgive me.""","

""Oh comrade, it is In the past and all is forgiven"" says Dimitri.

The Communist then turns to another friend.

""Petya, remember being sentenced in 1937 to 25 years in the gulag? Well, it was me who went to the NKVD. Please forgive me.""

""No more hard feelings, my friend. You are forgiven,"" says Petya.

""Misha, I must confess to you that I had you sent to the penal battalion in 1942. I am terribly sorry about that day.""

""Please my friend, we all forgive you. You may go in peace,"" says Misha.

""Thank you, comrades, for being with me throughout all these years,"" says the old communist with a tear streaming down his face. ""I don't know where I'd be if it wasn't for you. I‚Äôm sorry for betraying you all, and I hope you will forgive me.""

His friends are visibly touched by his words. Finally, he gathers his last strength and says.

""And in honor of our deep friendship I want you to fulfill my last wish. See that cactus plant on the windowsill? As soon as I die, I want you to take it and shove it up my ass.""

Just as his friends were about to say something the old communist took his last breath.

So Petya goes to the window, takes the cactus plant off and with the other two holding up the old communist‚Äôs legs, shoves it up their dead friend's butt. Suddenly, they hear a loud banging on the door followed by a gruff voice shouting:

""Open up, it's the police. We've received information that an old Bolshevik has been tortured to death.""",2021-11-16 16:22:40,12522

People are arguing about capitalism and communism and regulation and what ideology to identify as and blah blah blah. I say fuck that shit. 

This sub started as a fundamentally communist sub-reddit. I get that. It may feel like your space is being coopted by people who don't share your ideology. They may even hold ideologies you feel are inherently evil/flawed/etc. You may feel like it's watering down your cause. I get that. I really do. But fucking deal with it... for now.

You may want to push people away or convince them to convert to your particular brand of Truth‚Ñ¢ but let it go for now. I think everyone can agree on a few things

&#x200B;

\-A liveable minimum wage that scales with inflation

\-Benefits and PTO for all employs

\-Medicaid for all(or some form of socialized health care)

\-Workers rights to dignity and job security

&#x200B;

These are already enormous asks in a society as broken as ours. But here we are, almost 1,000,000 strong, all agreeing on these points. Lets go for them. Together. Capitalist, communist, socialist, whatever. We don't have to form some unending union. We don't have to agree about everything. We don't even have to like eachother. But we all agree on this.

Lets fucking take it. Together. 

If we succeed and get all this, all the capitalists will either leave the subreddit or they will ""see light."" You will be one step closer to your goal at minimum and have gained members for your next fight at best.

And even if you lose that next fight, wouldn't you rather at least have the consolation prize of those things listed above?

People WILL try to break this up. People WILL try to stop this. We must not let them succeed. We must see past the arbitrary lines that divide us. This is not a team sport. While we may disagree on many things, we must view each other as allies, not adversaries. 

The rage of society is beginning to bubble over but, just as easily as it can be used for gain, it can destroy itself. Always remember who you are really fighting and what you are fighting for.",2021-10-26 15:08:39,617

The problem with non-presidential election years is that the pinkos are too lazy to stop cooooming pornhub videos on the their Nintendo Switch's long enough to remember to vote. But that doesn't mean all of them will. The normies don't remember it either, so this is the time when the fucking lunatic Tankies can crawl out of the wood work and win an election 150 to 140.

Don't be a Useful Idiot. Use this weekend to research your candidates. Go down to the Board Of Elections and find out who the candidates are and who is endorsing them. Listen to their rhetoric and see if they're based. Try to avoid RINO's where you can too, an (R) doesn't mean shit.

If you hear ""Equality, Inclusion, Diversity, Tolerance, Experts"" fuck that shit.

I already listened to a local school board candidate talk about how Science is ""revolving"". As opposed to another who said ""The constitution maximizes choice"". Guess which one got the vote? Hint: ""trust the I fucking love revolving Science"" ain't it.

Remember, in Kentucky, it was the dumb fuck mayor / principal that gave himself a lap-dance with a boy on tax-payer dime. In Virginia, the Loudon County school board covered up a rape to protect the collective honor and reputation of a class of people that Reddit admins protect.

Don't give me any black pills about ""hurr durr election integrity"", we both know what went down, but you should also know that the elections were perfectly fortified in *specific* counties, not all of them.

It is confusing to see Indians in the present time having no idea about this fact, evidently from lack of reading their works, and further using ""communist"" and ""maoist"" as an insult. 

It reminds me of a picture I saw once. It was of two statues - Savarkar (a Hindu nationalist) and Bhagar Singh (an atheist & a communist) side by side. Quite shocking how one can support both.

To do so, they're gonna basically coerce you into getting the protection against this virus (for your own good, ofcourse).


On top of all this, the government gets the vaccine from pharmaceutical companies that have been fined billions of dollars in the past for being criminals. Not only that, the pharmaceutical companies that make the vaccine aren't held responsible for any severe reactions to the vaccine You may have (which are rarely talked about).

Maybe the saddest part of all this is if you get the vaccine because you wanted to ""take one for the team"" but then you react really badly to it, most people will either be sceptical when you tell them or will straight up just make fun of you coz they think you're an anti-vaxxer for some reason.

But hey, let's force this vaccine onto kids, when we don't even know what the long term effects on them are. And when the virus isn't really even a threat to children in the first place.

I would be willing to consider the idea that the powers that be (WHO, big pharma, governments, etc.), really do care about people's health and they're just reacting in a misguided way because of fear, but there's a weird vibe in the way the vaccine is being pushed and in how the vast majority of people are not only blindly obeying, but they actively defend what's being done to them. Even when you give them actual evidence.

So either this all just about the government gaining more power over the people (through surveillance and so on) and big pharma making more money, or it's much deeper than that.",2021-11-26 09:32:27,69

Uses all those alliances and votes he aquires by his titles to abolish the nobility and title system, replacing it with a robust democracy. 


Sells all those fancy houses he aquires and just buys a brownstone in London with Sirius that is close to all their favorite music venues and bars. Is also a complete punk house and all their friends live there because their codependent as fuck. 


Money is missing from his money bag. It's in Ron's trunk. They fight. Ron keeps telling Harry to stop giving him more galleons, the vault was enough.


Takes his wealth that is ""40x bigger than any other wealthy family"" and just, erases poverty in the Wizarding World. Every single poor wizard gets a house, their debts paid and some ways to raise food on their land. Uses some of wealth to make the Weasleys just slightly richer than the Malfoys just to annoyed them. 


Ginny gives Harry a love potion but it was so he could try getting out of a test. It backfires and they both fall deeply in love with McGonagall for a day. 


Harry does date Daphne Greengrass, and instead of learning the benefits of being gray from her, instead he radicalizes her into becoming a raging leftist. She starts screaming at her parents about being nuetral. They don't mind the funny smell that starts coming from her room the summer after dating Harry, probably doing ritual. Must be intense because afterwards she goes into the kitchen and eats everything. 


Finding out about marriage contracts, Fred and George keep sending them to Harry with increasingly bizzare requirements. 


Harry is your classic fight me punk, Ron is a bit of a crust punk/gamer punk. Hermoine is your classic ""looks very proper but was arrested last week at a political protest"" punk. Ginny has strong leather dyke vibes. Twins deal acid. Sirius is punk but is big into 80s glam rock aesthic. Remus is our token sad Boi. Tonks changes aesthic very often. Most surprising to all is when at a hard-core show, Hermoine meets McGonagall at the mosh pit and McGonagall breaks her nose. 


No harem however Harry is in a polycue with about 4 different people. However each of them have their own relationships and he isn't special in them.

249,q71f8c,Wobulating,CMV: Communism is a fundamentally unworkable economic system,"To start with, I am defining communism as an economic system where all property is publicly owned, and resources are given to citizens to fulfill their needs, as described by Marx.

This system, however, has a number of fundamental flaws that are inherent to it and cannot be escaped.

Its largest problem, by far, is that it stifles innovation and growth. If your rewards are guaranteed, and are guaranteed to be equal, then there's very little motivation to work harder and innovate more, because there's no personal reward from it.

To provide an example, I'll use chickens and eggs. If you're a farmer with a chicken coop and you make enough eggs(let's say 100 a month as a totally arbitrary number) to fulfill your quotas, off of 20 hours a week of work. You *could* raise more chickens, maybe bump it up to 200 eggs, but why would you? You would need to build a bigger coop, spend more time caring for them, shovel more waste out and more food in, and it's just generally a lot more work. Maybe if you did double the number of chickens, you'd be fed up and you'd try to make an automatic chicken feeder, so it took less time for you, and maybe you'd even bump it up to 300 eggs with this new-fangled chicken feeder, but if you're on 100 eggs, there's just not much pressure. The entire point of communism is that whether you get 100 or 300 eggs, you are still rewarded about the same, so why put in the extra effort?

There are, of course, proposed solutions, often quotas- but those have a very poor track record, for the simple reason that setting quotas is *really hard*. Set them too high, and your citizens can't reach them and they hate you, and set them too low, and just don't get very much stuff done, and figuring out how much is too high or too low is really, really difficult. There's a million factors that go into determining the maximum amount that a person can reasonably produce, and such a top-heavy approach simply cannot account for them. 

&#x200B;

To step higher up, planned economies like this(and communism does demand a planned economy) have *really* bad track records. Markets and environments change dramatically and quickly, and it's very hard for top-heavy economies to respond well to those sorts of changing circumstances. It's very hard for people to respond to change, generally, especially if there's no personal stake. If the central planner goes home at the end of the day no matter what, then they probably aren't gonna get super invested in whether or not all the stuff that they're responsible for is performing optimally. 

Additionally, they're simply much worse at creating that innovation that drives the world forward- as outlined, they decrease personal desire to innovate, but even for the people who *do* want to make something new, it's much more difficult. Creating something new and exciting is, at the end of the day, going to take resources and time, and if you have to petition a bureaucrat a hundred miles away to let you do this, that's a huge barrier to entry.",2021-10-12 21:20:31,1353

Real communism may have not ever been achieved, but it has certainly been *attempted*, and to ignore that ignores the real and tangible contributions of real people to the theory and practice of socialism. Mao, Lenin, Castro and Stalin all read and wrote extensively about Marxist theory and made many justifications on how their policies would bring their respective countries closer to the ideal of Marx. If you would want to establish real communism, you have to see how past people did it and what they got right and wrong. And it's not as if they were all charlatans either who only cared about money or big mansions - that kind of thinking leads to small men who get overthrown easily. A lot of these people genuinely bought into their own bullshit and believed that communism would be achieved within their lifetimes.
2. It's a self-fulfilling redundancy where you essentially define your ideology as being perfect, and any attempt to do it where it goes wrong can be easily disavowed because if it were truly attempted, it would obviously succeed. Communism may be an ideal, but it is also inherently flawed because of the means available to us to achieve that ideal in the first place, no?",2021-11-25 19:16:08,914
270,qh1vlb,shilderyi,u want fair fair living wages ? u need communism,"tldr: company rob you when you work and when you buy things

&#x200B;

i see lots of people here being like "" i don't care how but i want a living wages to pay food and house""

hey you know what ? lots of people wanted that before and they made books and knowledge for it to happen or even acted for it 

i don't just talk about Marx him and Engels has made good base but you don't need to know everything about them just ONE thing: 

how value is created and divided 

and in this case there is only three thing that matter: ressources, tool and work 

all that is charged in the prices that doesn't come from this three is a capitalist theft and that's how this system work 

that's how bezos can throw big pack of metal into space 

because every time you buy a thing on amazon you pay the resources needed to create the object, the cost of maintenance of the tools and the time of work the worker put into the creation process AND a little plus fully arbitrary that make money for amazon 

but this little plus don't have any means it offer nothing to the quality of the product cause all the creation cost have been covered by the creation cost of the thing you buy 

so if you want ypur fair share and a living that is easy organize, unionize strike and fight the bourgeoisie to get the control of the price of thing 

communism has an history full of this (look the union in europe for example the history of cgt in france that started as an anarcho communist union striking in the factories because by doing so they make 0 wealth forcing the boss to get into discussion on wages or work time in the day/week)

286,r1lols,Quiann,How should Communism and Fascism be treated during end game.,"In Vic2, Communism and Fascism both have relatively little impact during the late game. There are some changes domestically, a new flag but nothing that reflects the diplomatic impact post communist revolution.

Fear of a communist revolution was a major historical factor in European diplomacy. Russia going communist IRL was a BFD that both immediately triggered foreign intervention & dominated European politics up to ww2 (& beyond). In vic2 Russia going communist doesn't affect much outside of Russia.

My thoughts would probably be that a communist revolution should pretty much immediately prompt a diplomatic event, should prompt hostility from capitalist countries and give a communist player decisions to be more nationalist or internationalist. I would also make Fascism more likely to try and press expansionist claims relatively quickly. 

Anyone else have some thoughts?",2021-11-24 20:29:46,547

Then the comments are full of people saying ""under the URSS you would be killed"", then both sides start with ""that's not real -ism"", then people up voting their views and downvoting the others instead of trying to understand each other.

422,qncen2,Dougtoss,"Ian Kershaw‚Äôs Essay ‚ÄúWorking towards the F√ºhrer: Reflections on the Nature of the Hitler Dictatorship‚Äù Masterfully Contrasts Soviet Communism With Nazism, Dispels Horseshoe Theory","Ian Kershaw is perhaps the best working English historian on the subject of the Third Reich and Holocaust. His work, particularly since 1991, has caused a revolution in academic approaches to German society between 1933-45. His detailed studies of the Holocaust do not focus exclusively on the spectacle of horror, but rather how that horror arose from state and society. 

However, outside of professional history, a pre-1991 view predominates. This approach to Holocaust studies is an artifact of the Cold War, where there was a political need to create false equivalency between the Third Reich and Soviet Union. Arendt‚Äôs theory of Totalitarianism, the basis of Horseshoe Theory, starts with the premise that the USSR resembles the Third Reich, Stalin Hitler and so on, and falsifies or omits evidence to support that conclusion. 

Kershaw, in the essay quoted below, does not exonerate the USSR of human suffering, or Stalin of paranoia,  but simply demonstrates that rapid industrialization and heavy-handed response to cyclical famines are fundamentally rational state projects supported by violence, as opposed to the Third Reich which was guided by the principle of charismatic leadership and so pursued violence for its own sake, with no definitive goal.

&gt;  The renewed emphasis, already visible in the mid-1980s, on the intertwined fates of the Soviet Union and Germany, especially in the Stalin and Hitler eras, has become greatly intensified in the wake of the upheavals in Eastern Europe. The sharpened focus on the atrocities of Stalinism has prompted attempts to relativise Nazi barbarism‚Äîseen as wicked, but on the whole less wicked, than that of Stalinism (and by implication of communism in general). The brutal Stalinist modernising experiment is used to remove any normative links with humanising, civilising, emancipatory or democratising develop- ment from modernisation concepts and thereby to claim that Hitler‚Äôs regime, too, was‚Äîand intentionally so‚Äîa ‚Äòmodernising dictatorship‚Äô. Implicit in all this is a reversion, despite the many refinements and criticisms of the concept since the 1960s, to essentially traditional views on ‚Äòtotalitarianism‚Äô and to views of Stalin and Hitler as ‚Äòtotalitarian dictator

&gt; But the fundamental problem with the term ‚Äòtotalitarianism‚Äô‚Äîleaving aside its non-scholarly usage‚Äîis that it is a descriptive concept, not a theory, and has little or no explanatory power. It presumes that Stalinism and Hitlerism were more like each other than different from each other. But the basis of comparison is a shallow one, largely confined to the apparatus of rule.

Kershaw produced four arguments, quoted at length below. I have pinned the fourth, as I find it best answers the argument that there was a similarity between the USSR and Nazi Germany, and that any ideological similarity (‚Äúhorseshoe‚Äù) exists between Communism and Nazism. A collection of Kershaw‚Äôs essays, the first of which inspired this post, [can be found here](http://library.lol/main/08AB756A0EC462EB98D3DB29EEA588B9) .

&gt; First, however, let me outline a number of what appear to me to be significant points of contrast between the Stalinist and Hitlerist regimes.

##E: Reddit Formatting Sucks - Kershaw‚Äôs arguments have been put as relies to the pinned reply, with numbering intact. Sorry about that, it‚Äôs annoying I know. Number 4 is the summarizing argument I find most compelling.",2021-11-05 09:31:33,101

Here are some examples :

&#x200B;

[Socialist america \(credit:u\/MutedSherbet\)](https://preview.redd.it/zu7m30e288t71.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b7913a09e63a0125f718dd7564d62f5d7141ec06)

Why is this the case you ask ?

Well because socialist/communist party in victoria has some unique features that allow them to be more successful than other parties :

\- Speedrunning social reforms: As a socialist or communist nation you have the ability to quickly pass all the social reforms. Social reforms is the most decisive factor to decide who industrializes the best and since these parties can past the most social reform in the fastest time possible they clearly have a great advantage to them. And since these parties can past excellent healthcare reforms fast their population will sooner or later outgrown other nations as well as their industrial scores

\- Factory throughput: Only socialism and communist party give  factory throughput bonus while other parties dont. This is why commie factories are more efficient than most factories owned by capitalist. Albeit communist and socialists factories are more expensive. Also socialism or communism ensures equal distribution of factory throughput to all factories while capitalists can only give boost to some factories they own 

\- Employment and promotion : Communist and socialist parties with subsidies will employ all factories workers compared to other parties and this will dramatically boost industrial points since there are more workers working in factories. Another fact is that socialist/communist parties will either slow down capitalist promotion rate or turn all rich people into workers and this is great because it will get rid of landowners who dont add a lot of values to society than taking most of farmer rgo income and also the capitalist that takes income from factory workers too

\- Taxes efficiency : Communist/socialist parties give a lot of tax eff and this is great for whenever you need to wage war or build forts

Some downsides : You may have to micromanage your economy a lot but other than that socialism and communism in vic 2 is completely broken and op . Also I‚Äôm pretty sure socialist parties still allow capitalist to invest in factories so I guess socialist party are more optimal",2021-10-13 09:39:25,594

479,qxdobg,Long_Cow_2311,Trans self ID and British communism???,"Hello, just a preface I'm NB and pro trans obviously. I've been looking into the British Communist Party and one of their lines is denying people self ID. 
This made me angry. As you can imagine. Not only is denying people of self ID because of 'cis men using it to abuse women' is ridiculous in itself. But from a communist pov is it not the absolute antithesis of communism to have to get the government to confirm your gender.
I understand yes that the British Communist Party isn't exclusively a trans right movement, however I find it baffling that they would put such a polarizing line in their manifesto. 
Please no TERF's I don't care about your opinion I would like a rational answer to this.
I look forward to hearing your views.",2021-11-19 04:46:16,17
