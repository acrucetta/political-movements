35,r3c9es,inverseflorida,"If Leftist activists are a problem, but socially liberal causes are important, then we should encourage Liberal activists.","Leftists are probably hurting liberal social causes.

That's honestly not controversial here. This idea is basically the priors of about 70% of this subreddit, with the remaining 30% being people who are wary about people who seem overenthusiastic about bitching about Wokeism(TM) because it's been a trend on this sub since last year to get just that little bit more succon, and so their reaction is probably ""Uh, what do you mean by leftists, and liberal social causes?"" - and then if you explained, most of them would probably agree anyway.

Ages ago, I'd started writing a draft effortpost about the damage that I think leftist control of trans issues does to trans issues. It was half rant - as probably most trans women on here can attest to, leftist culture and leftist norms dominate trans spaces, and being out of line with them will lead to you being made an example of in some vicious, nasty ways. It's not just damaging when you're a target - it's damaging even when you're part of the ingroup, because it fucks with your head in an invisible way when you swallow some of the insane social norms and practices - you get all your opinions from social pressure. And like everyone who escapes from a seemingly all-pervasive ingroup with such totalizing, black and white, social pressure, you're desperate to see your escape from that social pressure validated, or to try to hit back and go hard to reclaim your sanity. You first start with tentatively questioning things with a lot of caveats, when deep down, you feel insane that you're having to add caveats to things that seem to make perfect sense, while also feeling insane because ""why does nobody else realize this?"". I thought the rant nature was appropriate - people just beginning to get out of that mindset, or people fresh out of it, would appreciate the extra tug.

But as the sub got just that little bit worse on trans issues, I shelved it indefinitely. It's the sort of thing that'd probably be fine to post somewhere where there's no question of attitude to trans issues, but at a time when ""DAE anti-woke?"" posting is at an all time high, it didn't seem appropriate.

But I started that post by pointing out that one of the first trans athletes in American olympic history said, on her facebook, was that [her dream was to win an American gold medal, so she could burn the American flag on the podium.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/more-sports/olympic-athlete-promises-to-burn-a-us-flag-on-the-podium-if-she-wins-a-medal/ar-AALkgBj?ocid=uxbndlbing)

Holy fuck.

Could you imagine what that would've fucking done? Trans issues can already seem, to normal people, like the fringe, radical, weird ""obviously some stuff goes too far"" invalid social issue because of its association with leftists, cancel culture, ""twitter Wokes(TM)"", and so forth. How much worse when you dig that association in with concrete headlines like ""First trans olympic medalist burns the American flag on podium""? How many normie moderates would this push over the line, or how many of the few remaining ""live and let live"" conservatives would radicalize in response to this as right wing and other Facebook media jumped up to say ""You see? Trans people really are these radical extremists!""

And the worst part is that we know that a significant number of other trans women, in their continued attempts to burn our hard won, miniscule social capital to the ground, would immediately start celebrating it, and making this very, very, *aggressively* clear to everyone online, just to make sure the discourse is as bad as possible, and just to also make sure there's extra fuel for anyone who wants to link being trans to being a leftist antifa extremist anarchist who hates America. They'll make sure to tell everyone ""Yes! You're right! That's what it means! We are unironically in favour of this!"".

So I think it's pretty intuitive to say - leftists are probably hurting liberal social causes. 

This isn't an online issue. Leftist activists take over boards of things like NYC pride because leftist culture online, and remaining part of the ingroup, is very important to the types of young people who get *that involved*. [That's why NY Pride banned cops from attending, despite this being opposed by the actual members of NY pride, because the board overruled them.](https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-health-coronavirus-pandemic-6fa351ba72230b59bf76ec8d51024e40) All those twitter threads about how if you support cops you're being homophobic, or endorsing violence to anyone who's LGBT, and so much else, is kind of undermined by that fact that the rank and file NY pride people couldn't even support that measure, and had to have it ruled over them.

That means liberals should try to take those social causes back.

\----

I think a lot of people's first instinct is ""That's not possible, they own the issues now, there's nothing we can do about it"". I'm gonna address that in a moment. Because first, it's not really enough to go on our intuitions, we should also probably get some evidence that a certain breed of leftist activism hurts liberal social causes.

Based and Taco-pilled Professional Tweeter Matt Yglesias posted on his substack ""[How to be an anti-racist](https://www.slowboring.com/p/how-to-be-an-anti-racist)"", which got a little traction around here, but inspired a realization in me that made me think this post was important enough to write.

One of the things his substack post does is go into the evidence that a certain brand of leftist behaviour around social issues probably damages the social issues. In terms of tweets online, [he cites a study that shows evidence that leftist posts about race are rated as less informative, more objectionable, generate more backlash from conservatives, and fail to persuade ""racial moderates""](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f48vgfadd23226r/TwitterDiversity.pdf?dl=0). While meanwhile, ""moderately progressive"" posts generated more persuasion. That's pretty good evidence!

Also listed, are backlash effects from corporate diversity training, which given how much of a shift there is in these spaces to be informed by people like [Tema Okun (Click through for an example)](https://www.fleurlarsenfacilitation.com/blog-full/2020/11/29/fjsdemza736kkbg0qfuzs543chmmaz), well... I think that supports the premise as well.

That's not *much* evidence to support the intuition that leftist activism is harmful and liberal activism would be more effective, I grant - but I figure the intuition is strong enough that you just saw some links while I confirmed your priors and went ""Damn! Based and Evidence-pilled again!!!!! Priors neva eva lose!!!!!!""

But I think frankly, even if there wasn't evidence of it harming the cause in terms of public opinion, the evidence that it harms the causes via the effects it has on the people it's supposed to advocate for are frankly reason enough to care. I genuinely, legitimately don't think there will be one trans user who reads this post and goes ""Actually, leftist dominance of trans spaces has never negatively effected me"".

Some people would say ""But that's just online, not real life"" - again, remember NY pride. Gay leftists are the ones who overruled the normal people, taking over positions of power in important organizations, and probably the types of important organizations that say, media people consult with to learn what the appropriate, sensitive language is, or what kind of things are correct to say about trans people - in a real way, it provides really strong control over the narrative! 

Leftists also believe in intersectionality - that is, that all these causes and issues are inseparable, and that this should be emphasized as much as possible. The practical result is that the issue will never be separated, in public, from other causes, and so whatever cause is being represented by leftists, will be associated with every other leftist cause as they grow more power over activist organizations. 

It's very easy to sound like you're exaggerating, alarmist, and insane over this stuff, but huge swathes of leftist culture are basically dangerous to liberalism! It's bad mentally to be in, and it basically outright encourages thinking not based on the facts, or reason - which can be hostilely dismissed as dudebro culture or whatever the fuck - but on basically just [pure social influence.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/lfyx3n/social_influence_tara_reade_deplatforming_and/) I have posted about this before, [but opinions in leftist spaces get washed through a complex process of authority, social proof, and rationalization, while also creating immense social and moral pressure to make adopting whatever the Right Opinion is mandatory.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/js84tu/how_did_defund_the_police_stop_meaning_defund_the/) If you're someone who touches grass, and doesn't get involved in these sorts of things, this might seem like an insane, alarmist description of it - that's why I linked two posts (one not by me even!) describing at basically the same thing to try to get it across. It's why opinions spread in leftist spaces the way they do - and it's one more reason why it's important that we try to ensure that liberal perspectives can win out for liberal causes.

And at the end of it all, I think some people would just decide that it's not worth our time, as Neoliberals(TM), to make the effort, because there are more important issues. But, well, we're liberals. Spending all our time listening to the milton friedman lecture about pencils on repeat while inserting why nations fail into every conversation is only half the picture. Being liberals doesn't just mean that we like economics. Social issues are very much liberal issues as well, and liberal voices need to be heard in social issues again.

I have a really simply solution to this: Liberals should become activists, or interested in supporting activists.

I think a major objection some people would have is inefficacy, given that we and many other politically engaged liberals are just random posters on the internet. True, but we also have a subreddit that has its own legitimate Washington based think tank, and chapters in cities all over the world with real life meetups and networking. There's already neolib-aligned groups that go to take YIMBY action in city councils, why can't there be similar groups that do something for social causes?

But as people would generally recognize, social causes are very hard, and doing social causes to attempt to replace leftist influence is an extremely steep mountain to climb for the amount of liberals who can be bothered to do something at all. All of that's true, but it's not an argument against doing activism. A marginal positive effect is a marginal positive effect - why shouldn't we pursue that? If you pursue marginal positive effects over time, then they add up. I'm fully aware that there's not going to be some massive liberal activist org over night that can engage in Evidence Based Activism or fund and support mass deep canvassing efforts, since I don't even know if the HRC can afford that sort of thing. 

But a beginning investment in the kind of infrastructure, knowledge, framework, experience, support, or spaces in general for liberal approaches to social causes, particularly anything that emphasizes an evidence based approach, could have a lot of potential for success. Even if they're small successes, over time creating these networks of liberal social activists, even if they don't do much other than assist in research for effective ways of reducing prejudice, or create and promote liberal perspectives on the issues with like meme instagram pages, or whatever, can build up over time. That's the value of organizing.

It can also be the beginning of a sort of subculture ecosystem for genuinely liberal approaches to socially liberal causes, including media and communities. And anyone who says this wouldn't have any effect should keep in mind that r/neoliberal is a subreddit that has a think tank and is influential enough that people go ""Okay, this is a branch of analytic philosophy.""

We have a lot of complaints, in general, about leftist approaches to social causes that we also care about. If we think this is important, then I suggest, we should do something about it. This is the idea that I have.

It's definitely not much. But we don't need to leave marginal positive utility on the table while the cost per unit is low enough to make it profitable!",2021-11-27 06:04:36,570
36,r3hupj,bussyboyfourtwenty,I don’t want people to reduce me to my sexuality. Liberals are absolutely the worst at this.,"This past thanksgiving, my well-meaning aunt confided in me that she’s incredibly frustrated with the out gay guy who works in her office. Because he eats at Chic Fil A. Yeah, that’s literally it. He’s a nice guy who enjoys mediocre sandwiches by all accounts. My aunt boycotts them, and in her own words “I stick up for him, but he can’t even stick up for himself!”

To be clear, I love her and I wouldn’t change a thing about her. But I bring this up because, having grappled with my non-straight orientation long ago, I have long come to the conclusion that I just don’t want people reducing me to “that gay guy” or assuming I have x beliefs or do x thing because I’m gay. In other words, what I absolutely do not want is racial essentialism but gay. And “gayssentialism” is exactly what libs are so good at.

My aunt’s case is very benign, but others have astounded me with their prejudice under the guise of liberal compassion. Someone once told me, to my face, that they weep for the gay community if the average gay man is like me. Why did they say this? Because I didn’t care either way about Dave Chappelle’s latest special. Going further, liberals often view my accomplishments through my sexuality. I can’t just be a good cook, I’m a good cook because I’m gay. I’m not just good at my job, I’m a “power gay getting that fabulous coin” (actual text I got once when talking to a straight girl about a job I landed). Typically people stop outwardly doing that if I ask, but some nonces refuse and call my “commitment to the queer community” into question.

I honestly question if gay men are even a community. In my experience, we’re a group of chill dudes who like sucking dick who got taken over and co-opted by what are essentially spicy straight women and TRAs (I’m not anti-trans but I firmly believe the movements are separate with different end goals). Apart from leaving us alone and not actively trying to make us second-class citizens, most of us just wanna vibe as the world slowly descends into capitalist chaos. 

Why can’t libs just do that? Why do they need to view a single, small part of our identity as the most important part of our being?",2021-11-27 11:08:04,829

These results shouldn’t be representative for the whole population but more for the community here on Reddit. And when you look at the percentages, you can indeed see the trend, that Sensors tend to be more conservative.

Rittenhouse went there deliberately to kill people and got lucky - bad faith

January 6 was an abomination, caused primarily by Trump, and there is zero justification for it - good faith

January 6 was just a bunch of pissed off patriots fighting for their country - bad faith

With the amount of evidence in both cases, it's fairly easy to assess each situation. If a person digs their heels in on these points, they are either misinformed or politically motivated. Either of which makes it virtually impossible to have a good faith discussion.

If you haven't read about this already, this particular article really does a great deep dive into his past transgressions:

[https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2021/11/22/suspect-waukesha-parade-incident-identified-darrell-brooks-jr/8717524002/](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2021/11/22/suspect-waukesha-parade-incident-identified-darrell-brooks-jr/8717524002/)

It's hard to know where to even start with all of this. I've gone into this so much over the past 2 years that I am getting tired at this point. I'll keep this as short as I can: my party, the Democratic party, has absolutely no answers for crime, let alone the recent nationwide crime wave.

At this point, in light of the Waukesha incident, I am forced to say that the Democratic party deserves to lose every upcoming election until such time as they can find their way on crime, if that is even possible.

To be clear: yes I am a liberal Democratic voter. No I am not a Republican voter or supporter. I am also on the side of law and order, and always have been. Many would say this means I have no place in the Democratic Party. Whether you are on the left or the right, you are free to hold that opinion. I can't explain why I feel so strongly about law and order. I am female, so maybe that has something to do with it. You see things from a different perspective when you walk through a dark parking garage and realize that if something happens, you are probably going to be screwed by not only a criminal but by a hapless courts system. See article above for hints about what happens to people who commit serious felonies against women. Hint: they are let out of jail right away.

Something I don't think is based on opinion: the Democratic party has no answers or solutions for crime other than wishing it would go away. The past 2 years have shown that the combination of ""wishing"" and activist-led crusades like ""bail reform"" have led to a sharp rise in crime. In other words Democrats have been 100% wrong about crime and have no answers to stop it. This is inexcusable.

Because Democrats have no answers for crime, we are going to lose future elections and therefore lose other things we care about, such as abortion rights, LGBT rights, etc. I wonder if my fellow Democrats are thinking about this or worried about this? We are going to lose it all, folks. We are going to lose it all because the party is beholden to a few left wing activists who claim that literally ANY law enforcement action and or criminal punishment is racist.

This is all so insane, and the average American knows it. I'm not sure if this Waukesha incident will be the tipping point for all of this because I'm not sure the mainstream media will allow it to be, but it should be. It deserves to be.

As I say I come in peace. I hope we don't have to fight about my political affiliation--either way. Why am I making this post? Partly to vent, and party because I hope someone somewhere will get the message. This has got to stop. This is not the way. In the meantime, if you are someone who identifies as Republican/conservative, then please accept my congratulations. My party is literally handing you future elections (state and national) on a silver platter. Enjoy this windfall. If the shoe was on the other foot, I promise you I would.",2021-11-22 17:49:36,755

Here’s How. | NYT Opinion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNDgcjVGHIw)

I will summarize the main points, but the video is worth watching in its entirety. The essential argument is that while Democrats say X, even in the key states where they have almost no opposition, they don't do X. All of ""X"" prominently feature in this sub, so I believe it would be relevant. 

---
Summary: The video authors discuss three issues: housing, taxes, and education. 

 **Housing** 

California, for instance, has major housing issues mainly due to zoning. A particular example is in the Palo Alto area where NIMBYism led to voting no on a large construction project for housing elderly people. Even though Palo Alto added ~670k jobs, it added only ~176k housing units. This is despite Democrats saying housing is a fundamental right.

**Taxation**

Washington, it turns out, is more regressive than even Texas in terms of taxes with the lowest 20% income group paying 17% towards state tax, compared to richest 1% paying 3%. (Full disclosure: This may need finer reading because lying with statistics is easy, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was true).

**Education**

Democrats say education is a critical public good. However, in Cook county which contains Chicago, there are over 140 school districts. Affluent families in one district mean better school in that particular district which runs counter to everything democrats are doing.

The authors end by saying liberal cities still provide a lot of good, but suggest that blaming everything on the other party (only if GOP didn't exist everything would work out) is dubious. 

----

My thoughts: I think the video makes a lot of sense, and resonates with a lot of issues brought up in this sub. I feel the current war on ""us"" vs ""them"" needs to stop, and focus should be more on the exact policy. 

On how to achieve this, I have some broad suggestions: first policies should be conveyed to public in a non-populistic manner, and second, policies should have an accept/reject phase within a given time-frame lest we allow NIMBYism or other forms of obstruction to derail the agenda. 

What are your thoughts? Specifically, 

1. Are all the points made in the video are on point or is it a case of cherry-picking?
1. Would Dems having super-majority in all houses be a good thing? 
1. What do you think currently liberal states with Dem majority can do better other than the points raised in the video.",2021-11-13 02:51:37,173

But losing them by less matters. Glenn Youngkin understood this in Virginia, campaigning in areas he knew he would never win outright because he understood losing highly educated, upper-income voters in North Virginia 65-35 was a lot better than losing them 75-25 (don't quote me on the actual numbers but point is Youngkin cut down on the margin of defeat even in blue areas) and he boosted his base.

This video is an interesting exposition on how blue state policies are not being implemented in blue states. States have much broader power than the federal government, so it seems like policies should be ironed out on a smaller scale before being applied across the entire country.

The economy of California is larger than India, UK, or France; the economy of Texas is larger than Brazil; the economy of New York is larger than Canada. I don’t think one can make the argument that states are too small to experiment.

Democrats have been banging on the drum of income inequality, yet New York is the most unequal state (highest Gini coefficient) and California is 4th. The two states with the lowest gini coefficients are two red states—Utah and Alaska.

There are similar issues on the Republican side. For example, Republicans champion upward mobility and the American dream yet many in rural communities (and other communities) are stuck in a cycle of poverty.

But for a growing part of the country, the image of a rifleman walking through a supermarket or a protest brings mass shootings to mind.

The law tends to be pretty clear on the point that unless you’re actively breaking the law, carrying a gun doesn’t allow people to treat you as an aggressor for reasons of self-defence. You can’t point a gun at someone just for walking into Walmart carrying three legal guns and an ammo belt. 

Legal realities aside, though, wide swathes of the country have come to see open carry as an imminent threat of violence. And people are inevitably going to respond in kind.

158,qx6djd,heretocomplainorcry,My SO is hard-core conservative and I'm a moderate liberal. His political views emotionally exhaust me.,"My SO is the epitome of far right. His admiration for Trump is astounding. He echoes the viral arguments that ultra conservative news stations shout at him. He has almost no capacity for being an independent political thinker, although he's otherwise a very intelligent man.

I feel as though I'm a very moderate liberal. I care very deeply about the environment, education, and poverty. Many other social issues I'm very ""meh"" on. And in terms of fiscal policy I actually tend to lean right.

I avoid political discussion, simply because I feel as though the current political climate is very toxic and harmful and I prefer not to get involved. My SO, though, LOVES talking politics and it's ruining our otherwise very good relationship. 

Most of the time I agree with what he says for the sake of keeping the peace- and quite frankly, I don't care about most things he talks about. 

But occasionally he'll hit a nerve, and I'll feel the need to respond. This is when our talks get harmful to the relationship. He will NEVER admit that perhaps his political views are sitting on misinformed ideals or conflict with his own personal values. If I point out either of those things, he'll die on his hill trying to justify his far right idiocy. And I usually get very mad- because he's pushed me to that point.

For the last week he's been talking about the Rittenhouse case. For the most part I have kept my mouth shut, but tonight he said ""I'd be proud if my kid killed people rioting and looting"" and I lost my shit- because I wouldn't be proud if my child killed ANYONE- period. He's also anti-abortion ""because every life matters"". I pointed out that irony, and he said I was comparing two very different things.

Look, Rittenhouse was 16. My opinion is that a 16-year-old shouldn't have been in his situation, period. His parents messed up. He messed up. Anyone who allowed him to get as far as he did, messed up. My heart hurts for everyone involved- including Rittenhouse (although I don't really believe he's entirely innocent). BUT I sure as hell would not be proud if he was my child. I would be utterly devastated. 

And I'm utterly devastated that my SO said he would be proud. 

These comments come up, probably, every four months in our relationship. My SO will spew some outrageous far right bull shit and then he'll wonder why I ""get so emotional, when we're just having a political discussion"".

Maybe I get ""so emotional"" because I listen to bull shit come out of your mouth 24/7 and I never say anything, until you say something so outrageous that I HAVE to say something and all of the emotions I've been suppressing listening to your other bull shit, come out at the same time.

My SO is a really good guy. He's everything most women could want. But holy FUCK his political allegiance to the far right media is this close // to making me rethink a real future with him.

EDIT: Because without context he sounds terrible. He's got a lot of great qualities. He supports my small business and is not threatened by me making more than him- yet he still works and brings money to the household. He helps clean and views our home and family as a team responsibility. He's very respectful of my body. He treats his mom and sisters wonderfully. He's intelligent, funny, outgoing, adventurous, and puts up with my moody-tired-complaining ass every day. He IS a good guy. His political views just suck. But his political views are not who he is as a person, or how he treats me.",2021-11-18 20:47:31,204

[In Russia, the word ""liberal"" means capitalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/OliverMarkusMalloy/comments/qjsojb/russian_troll_subs_like_wayofthebern/). In Russia, Reagan is considered a liberal.

In America, liberal means ""freedom."" Liberalism is ""The Philosophy of Freedom.""

Liberals are free people, people who fight for freedom, or freedom fighters.

I'm an American liberal. I believe capitalism is destroying the world and UBI is inevitable. In Germany I'm a far-left Green. In the UK I'm Labour.

A lot of Americans call me a communist because I believe America needs free college, free healthcare, free childcare, free housing, free electricity, free wifi, free water, free roads & bridges, free public transit, and free UBI income.

In other countries many of these things are already a reality, and life for the working class is much better.

Does any of this sound like I'm a capitalist?

No. I oppose capitalism just like millions of other liberals, because liberal does not mean capitalism in America.

Most Democrats oppose capitalism, because it's a corrupt system that allows the rich to exploit the poor.

I see sterilizing myself as a means of making it physically impossible for American conservatives to force me to participate in the dominant cultural paradigm which got Trump elected and almost caused democracy to collapse in the United States this past January.

I see having kids as an act of emulating the culture of the Southern United States, and all the negatives that come with it such as sprawling and uninspiring cities, loud and bombastic rhetorical mannerisms, and hospitality which composes friendly interactions on the surface and judgement for those who don't conform beneath the surface. 

On the other hand, to be childfree is to emulate the cultural values of places such as the Pacific Northwest, the Netherlands, Sweden, Vancouver, etc. All of these places are filled to the brim with progressive, educated, secular, authentic, and childfree people (especially educated, intelligent, progressive, secular, empowered, and independent women), in addition to walkable and inspiring cities. 

If Ron DeSantis, Ted Cruz, etc. were to hypothetically become president of the United States, and force Americans to procreate like Nicolae Ceaușescu did in Romania, me having a vasectomy would physically incapacitate me from complying with such a draconian measure, and there wouldn't be anything they or their Evangelical base could do about it. Maybe I get sent to prison for a decade, but that sounds like heaven compared to being forced to raise kids.

Obviously the numbers among the general public are even higher. Compare this to the world of 2004 when Bush was re-elected on the back of anti-gay marriage sentiment and references to smoking weed were bleeped out on commercial radio stations.

Of course, the GOP has become more reactionary in other ways. Anti-immigrant sentiment is the most obvious. But liberals have gone a long way. Of course, extreme woke illiberalism like 'gender is entirely a social construct and if you're for patriarchy', all the Robin Diangelo bullshit, and so on are very unpopular but those people are not liberals.

The top states are Idaho and Utah, and large conservative states Texas, Florida, South Carolina, Georgia are all near the top of the list. The large liberal states California and New York have by contrast approved an abysmally low number of new houses. There are some conservative states near the bottom of the list, such as Mississippi and West Virgina, but these states have declining job opportunities and declining populations so do not need to add to their existing housing stock. There are also honourable exceptions of liberal states building quite a lot of houses.

This is just the data from last year, but population growth and internal migration trends suggest this will have held up over the last 10-15 years.

This is quite unexpected because California and New York have some of the [lowest home ownership rates in the country](https://ipropertymanagement.com/research/homeownership-rate-by-state) which *should* make house building politically easier and discourage NIMBYism.

355,r479mp,Lazy_Guess,What is wrong with women’s snowboard sizing? (GNU/Lib Tech/Bataleon/Never Summer/ETC),"TLDR; the majority of women’s boards between 150-155 length are not wide enough for the women who need those sizes because the width doesn’t increase much with length; even though the equivalent men’s boards do. They state that there isn’t much market for larger women’s boards and so they don’t sell as well, without addressing the glaring detail that women who are taller or bigger and need those lengths have larger feet and can’t ride their narrow boards. Does anyone know why they do this??? 🥴
 
I recently reached out to Lib Tech/GNU to inquire about why they don’t make their women’s boards in 150+ length wide enough for women with 8.5 or larger boots. I was told that they don’t offer as many longer women’s board sizes because they are the last to sell out and so it’s more costly to make... But the kicker is that snowboard companies across the board will make women’s boards in lengths up to 155. Seemingly without considering the waist width and sizing it up proportionally like they do with the equivalent men’s boards. The only women I know who are tall enough to desire a 152+ board and want to buy those larger sizes have feet no smaller than size 9. For example the 151.5 GNU Riders Choice is a whopping 25.1 cm width; while the GNU Ladies Choice 151.5 is a shockingly small 24.4 cm, and cannot accommodate larger than a size 8 boot. Similarly the 153.5 in the ladies choice is also a 24.4 waist width and does not increase; where at the 154.5 Riders Choice jumps slightly up to 25.2 waist width. This is not just mervin that does this however, it’s about 60-70% of manufacturers that I have come across, including Never Summer and Bataleon. It seems like the solution to longer women’s boards not selling would be to size them appropriately for the women who want to ride them. It seems like these companies are shutting a whole corner of the women’s market out and pushing consumers to accommodating brands like Capita or Jones who recognize that a boards width should increase with its length for women just like it does for men. Or even offering a dedicated women’s wide board. But I digress. Hopefully my emails/feedback will be heard and we can see some inclusivity or more Dope unisex and women’s volume shifted options. Anyways, happy shredding everone 🤘🏽",2021-11-28 09:51:12,45

407,qvojjo,namesrue,Reading more history has made me less of an anarchist. Seeking perspectives from well-read anarchists/lib socs.,"First of all, let me say that I still consider anarchists to be comrades, this isn't a post about ""anarkiddies"" or some other shit like that. I still love my anarchist comrades and am very sympathetic to their flagship revolutions/figures.

What has led me to become less of an anarchist and more sympathetic to Marxist-Leninists in particular is reading the history of communist revolution. Some conclusions I've come to:

##Revolutions are inherently about one class imposing its will on another.

**This necessitates hierarchy of some kind, as well as political repression.** In the same way that allowing fascist speech is dangerous, so is allowing bourgeois and reactionary speech. Effective revolutionaries must be willing to commit to repressing both.

##Leninist states aren't as bad as they are made about to be, particularly in the West.

As an American, I was subject to an extreme amount of propaganda about the USSR and Maoist China, and had no idea of their actual level of achievement for the working class. These governments did plenty of bad stuff that should never be underplayed, but this is also true of any successful leftist revolution.

**Despite these evils, by far the greatest achievements for the working class have been the result of ML movements.** That result should speak for itself.

##I care about more about abolishing the market than I do abolishing hierarchy.

Obviously doesn't apply to all anarchists, and I don't embrace hierarchy. But the way some anarchists embrace market economy is to me a sign that they have not truly grasped the evil of market commodification or class conflict. 

**I would rather live in a centralized command economy that guarantees me housing than a market ""anarchist"" one that may leave me homeless.** I've never met an ML that didn't understand this.

##""Siege"" socialism is made necessary by imperialism.

Look at the way Sankara, Bishop, Che, Lumumba, and Allende were taken out by imperialist and reactionary forces, and how they tried with figures like Castro. **Like with bourgeois speech, some degree of political repression and hierarchy is unfortunately necessary to survive domestic reactionaries aided by CIA spooks.**

Where would Burkina Faso be today if Sankara's administration had killed his usurper Blaise Compaore? Where would Chile be today if Pinochet spent the 70s and 80s in a gulag?  Where would Grenada be today if the New Jewel Movement stayed in power and Reagan never got the chance to invade? What would Cuba look like today if Castro was assassinated and Batista took power back?

In these cases, more severe political repression would have absolutely been justified with the benefit of hindsight.

##Vanguard parties aren't necessarily out of touch or ineffective.

The popularity of the Black Panthers transcends political ideology - they have been lauded by MLs, anarchists, democratic socialists, and even some liberals as an awesome manifestation of black liberation, and rightly so.

The problem is that the Panthers were MLs and explicitly organized as such, democratic centralism and all. Could an anarchist group that rejected Leninist organizational principles have achieved what the Panthers did?

With hindsight, it isn't clear to me that the answer is yes. **What the Panthers achieved took a unity of action that I haven't seen domestic anarchists in the U.S. prove themselves capable of**, but am happy to learn of a counter-example.",2021-11-16 20:18:14,216

I just found this sub recently and y’all have no idea how grateful I am because it seems like reddit removed any rad fem spaces it can. Most of the other feminist subreddits have gone to shit because of pandering lib fems and male “feminists” who have infiltrated them in order to give their hot takes on a system they will NEVER understand like women. 

I kid you not I had a male feminist call me a misogynist in another subreddit because I suggested that most women shouldn’t have casual sex because it’s not mutually beneficial. You can hardly even make any criticism of men because otherwise their handmaidens jump in to protect the oh so innocent men who rape,murder, and dehumanize women daily. I’ve become so nihilistic on whether or not female solidarity is even possible with the rise or pick-me’s who degrade other women for the sake of men who would not even spit on them if they were on fire. It feels like everything is going to shit with the rise of terrorist attacks on women and all there is to do is watch.
