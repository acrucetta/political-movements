6,r52yd1,Then-Meringue-955,At least you now know who amongst your friends and family would have helped the Nazis and Fascists 80 years ago,"I live in Italy. Starting from December 6th I, unvaxxed, cannot legally enter any bar, restaurant, gym, cinema etc, not even with a negative test. 


I feel like a majority of people even amongst my family and friends support the greenpass and the fact that me, their friend and relative, won't be able to have access to many places.

These same people 80 years ago would have supported the Nazis and Fascists in killing the Jews or at least would have turned a blind eye to what was happening, I'm 100% sure. It's a sad feeling realizing that. My opinion of them is forever changed.



(For all the trolls in the comments that will say unvaxxed people aren't like the Jews and that I just ""need to get the jab"": you're part of the problem and also your """"""vaccine"""""" DOES NOT FUCKING WORK. )

Edit: why is this sub full of shills now? It was the only safe space till a few weeks ago

Edit2: for the trolls: I'm not equating the unvaxxed to the Jews, I'm equating people like you to supporters of the Nazi regime, meaning that you are ok with discrimination based on arbitrary decisions, which is different, but I guess you wouldn't understand

Edit 3: fascism didn't begin with concentration camps. It began with excluding people from entering bars, restaurants, etc. Also in Australia there are already camps, so yeah... Please open your eyes",2021-11-29 13:03:51,1165
7,pwh08z,hobahobaparty,"Who is a fascist? Nowadays political opponents call each other ""fascists"" all the time but I have no actual idea what this means.","In the political talking nowadays you will see a lot of people throwing around the allegation that this or that political opponent is ""fascist"". 

I think it was Orwell who said - sometimes after WW2 - that the word fascist has become so devoid of meaning that it has come to mean just someone you don't like. 

However, in the beginning of fascism, probably the word had some actual meaning and was associated with some set of understanding as to how a country should be run. From what I have been taught at school, I can say for sure that the governments of Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco were fascist. I just do not know what makes them fascist and how the label ""fascist"" makes them different from other non-leftist dictators. 

I have also heard the word casually thrown around for other dictators like Pinochet, the Japanese government during WW2, and Chinese republican leader  Chiang Kai-shek, as well as (surprisingly for me) Israeli leader Menachem Begin.",2021-09-27 08:25:04,36

Today a fascist attacked me because of my ML ideas. It's a pretty dumb story. I know that guy because we were in the same school, his father was expelled from Russia by Putin because of some involvement in the chechen war. So he's from a pretty far right environment. He is an antisemite btw but he hates communists even more and Stalin is the person he hates the most.

He saw on Twitter that I'm a leftist and came to talk to me. I ended replying to him with memes of Stalin because the discussion was too dumb and he threatened me saying the next time he will see me he will kill me or something.
I responded with an other meme of Stalin. I did not thought it was serious.
I saw him two times the Friday at the mosque and he ignored me.

Then today he was with one of my friend, and I went to say hi. Then the guy showed me his Twitter account and after that he punched me. I fought back but tried to avoid the fight as much as a could (people were watching and it was a bit humiliating but I couldn't be in a state that let my mother know I was involved in a fight). 

A dude came to separate us and I went to my college after that.

There are literally [thousands of Russian trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/TRUTHsocialWatch/comments/qqpuae/how_to_spot_a_russian_troll_on_truth_social/) spreading anti-liberal propaganda on US social media. Many of them are even mods on reddit subs. They're easy to spot:

Fake leftie subs run by Russian trolls use the word ""liberal"" as a slur to attack Democrats 24/7. But you never see them attack the real capitalists: Republicans.

Every leftie sub that attacks Democrats with the word ""liberal"" instead of attacking Republicans with the word ""capitalist"" is a Russian troll sub.

[In Russia, the word ""liberal"" means capitalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/OliverMarkusMalloy/comments/qjsojb/russian_troll_subs_like_wayofthebern/). In Russia, Reagan is considered a liberal.

Ironically, Putin is considered a liberal too by the Russian definition of the word ""liberal.""

&#x200B;

Every American knows that ""liberal"" does not mean capitalism in America.

In America, liberal means ""freedom."" Liberalism is ""The Philosophy of Freedom.""

Liberals are free people, people who fight for freedom, or freedom fighters.

Republicans have been [smearing liberals with vicious lies](https://www.reddit.com/r/QanonKaren/comments/qrd5yi/no_democrats_are_not_baby_killers_no_abortion_is/) for decades.

Now [Russian trolls pretending to be American lefties are also smearing liberals with vicious lies](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdNews4U/comments/qsulua/russian_trolls_pretending_to_be_american_lefties/), to divide and conquer the American left.

&#x200B;

I'm an American liberal. I believe capitalism is destroying the world and UBI is inevitable. In Germany I'm a far-left Green. In the UK I'm Labour.

A lot of Americans call me a communist because I believe America needs free college, free healthcare, free childcare, free housing, free electricity, free wifi, free water, free roads & bridges, free public transit, and free UBI income.

In other countries many of these things are already a reality, and life for the working class is much better.

&#x200B;

Here are some of my anti-capitalist comics:

[Republicans have a very bizarre, very unhealthy relationship with capitalism. They worship it. And they hate your guts and see you as their enemy if you dare to criticize capitalism.

Does any of this sound like I'm a capitalist?

No. I oppose capitalism just like millions of other liberals, because liberal does not mean capitalism in America.

Most Democrats oppose capitalism, because it's a corrupt system that allows the rich to exploit the poor.

Don't let Russian trolls pretending to be American lefties brainwash you with vicious anti-liberal propaganda.

102,qncqbz,Settlemente,Vaccinated people who are still scared of COVID have OCD. Fearing something you're protected from only makes sense it you're mentally ill or a fascist who wants to control other people.,"When I traveled abroad, I didn't ask people to wear a mask or distance because I was worried about contracting diseases I'm vaccinated against. 

I don't worry every day of my life about getting polio, TB, measles, smallpox, or mumps. 

The point of vaccines is to prevent you from getting a specific disease. If you get a vaccine and still fear getting the disease, you meet the criteria for OCD and anxiety disorders. 

Symptoms of OCD:

>Obsession symptoms
OCD obsessions are repeated, persistent and unwanted thoughts, urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by performing a compulsive behavior or ritual. These obsessions typically intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things.

[From Mayo:](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354432)Obsessions often have themes to them, such as:

>Fear of contamination or dirt

>Doubting and having difficulty tolerating uncertainty

>Needing things orderly and symmetrical

>Aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others

>Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects

>Examples of obsession signs and symptoms include:

>Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched

>Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way

>As with obsessions, compulsions typically have themes, such as:

>Washing and cleaning
Checking
Counting
Orderliness
Following a strict routine
Demanding reassurance

Sounds like the mask Karen's at Walmart. 

Examples of compulsion signs and symptoms include:

>Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw

>Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase

Mask up. Back to normal. Jabs in arms....

>People with a phobia [(NIMH):](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders)

>May have an irrational or excessive worry about encountering the feared object or situation

Masks, social distancing, excessive hand washing/hand sanitizer use...

>Take active steps to avoid the feared object or situation

Lockdowns, masks, remote work...

>Experience immediate intense anxiety upon encountering the feared object or situation

Being around unmasked and unvaccinated people

>Endure unavoidable objects and situations with intense anxiety

Mask Karens. 

[Brookings:](https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-misinformation-is-distorting-covid-policies-and-behaviors/?amp)


>According to Johns Hopkins University, the COVID-19 case-mortality rate ‚Äì the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died from the disease ‚Äì is 1.6% in the United States. The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 30% of American Adults correctly estimate the rate as being less than 2%, while 20% believe the rate to be between 2% and 5%. Seventeen percent (17%) estimate the mortality rate to be in the 5%-10% range and 19% believe the rate is more than 10%. Another 14% say they‚Äôre not sure

[Gallup:](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/354938/adults-estimates-covid-hospitalization-risk.aspx)

>Perhaps because of different choices in news media consumption, Democrats are significantly more likely than other Americans to overestimate the death risk from COVID-19. Twenty-eight percent (28%) of Democrats think more than 10% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 have died from the disease ‚Äì more than five times the actual mortality rate. Just 14% of Republicans and the unaffiliated believe the COVID-19 mortality rate is over 10%.

>For both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, very few adults reported a correct answer, which is less than one percent. See the discussion in the appendix for details about the correct hospitalization rates and efficacy estimates. Only 8% of U.S. adults gave correct answers for the unvaccinated population and 38% for the vaccinated population.

>Partisanship was a strong predictor of accuracy, but party accuracy varied by whether the respondent was assessing the risk of the vaccinated or unvaccinated populations.

>For unvaccinated hospitalization risk, 2% of Democrats responded correctly, compared with 16% of Republicans. In fact, 41% of Democrats replied that at least 50% of unvaccinated people have been hospitalized due to COVID-19.

[Study in covid risks. ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.619145/full)


>The results show that respondents overestimated the probabilities to catch or die from COVID-19, which is not unusual and does not necessarily reflect a strong deviation from rational behavior.

>Many of them ‚Äî including proto-sceptic Toby Young and the Guido Fawkes blog ‚Äî pointed to research published in July showing that the average Briton thought that 7 per cent of the population had already been killed by the virus (and 10 per cent for the average Scot). On Wednesday, Young posted a Daily Mail story on Twitter that said 5 million Britons had already had the virus. ‚ÄúGiven that ~50,000 people have died from it, that means it has an IFR of <0.1%. That‚Äôs roughly the same as seasonal flu‚Äù tweeted the Toadmeister, in a now-deleted tweet.

[Infection fatality rate of COVID: ](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.08.21260210v1)

>Across all countries, the median IFR in community-dwelling elderly and elderly overall was 2.4% (range 0.3%-7.2%) and 5.5% (range 0.3%-12.1%). IFR was higher with larger proportions of people >85 years. Younger age strata had low IFR values (**median 0.0027%, 0.014%, 0.031%, 0.082%, 0.27%, and 0.59%, at 0-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69 year.**
 
If you got the vaccine because you believed it is 95% at preventing a disease with a fatality rate of 0.031% for 30-39 year olds, there is no valid reason you should be demanding society to changes in any way to alleviate your fear of COVID. 

I don't care what you do to protect against a disease. Get vaccinated. Don't. Wear a mask. Don't. I won't be demanding on social media that you be treated differently by the government or your employer because you address covid different than I do.

Personally I think this is completely deplorable, it is blatant fascist propaganda. 'Strong men' are literally superimposed in the auth right sector of the political compass, which is where Nazis and facists lie. 

The reference to Kali yuga is also used by the alt right warning that aryian prophets foretold the destruction of the modern world. Many posts on Instagram, Twitter, reddit etc. Implore readers to 'surf the Kali yuga' and circulate. The alt right using asian culture to spread messages isn't new either, with the most notable use being the Nazi swastika.

This doesn't even begin to touch on the logical fallacy that is ""strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times"". There are infinate ways to how this is nonsense, with one of the main points being it doesn't correctly line up with history; see... Middle ages

185,qxcfnt,brush_twice,The fascist authoritarian proletariat hating Modi rolled back farm laws giving into the demands of farmers?,"Almost like as if India is a democracy, right?

Call me neoliberal if you want but the farm laws were absolutely the step in the right direction. In fact, I'm almost blackpilled that most people were against it only because BJP were the ones who introduced the laws. I'm convinced no one in this country really gives a shit about the working class and it is just team sports and in that regard, it is actually sad that one good policy decision after so much of a shit show led to nowhere.

This lies squarely on the feet of the fear mongering the left did around the issue helped by the undemocratic fashion the bill was introduced in the parliament. In fact, over the one year the issue has been used as a wedge to communalize people and pitch Hindu communities against the Sikhs. Whether it's resurfacing of the Khalistani narrative, attacking on the Indian republic, or open murder. It felt less of a protest about farm laws and more as a narrative to oust BJP in the next election cycle. 

Why Modi didn't force in through? Because as much as people like to caricature him as this fascist neo nazi monarch, he is actually an image conscious opportunist... and this is how democracy is supposed to work. If you have a section of people who are absolutely convinced that passing certain laws will have their lives destroyed by some capitalist RSS boogeyman and they are getting targeted for being rich Sikhs, there is no way in hell a democratic government can go ahead with this. And it makes no sense to sit on the issue and let the whole thing used as tool to further communalize people. I personal think it was good thing, that instead of putting this on back burner, they decided to take a decision. I'm not happy with the decision, but I couldn't see how else they could pass this without being called spitting image of Hitler.

Also, ever since Amit Shah had COIVD last year, I personally think the toxic Hindu appeasing narrative of BJP has shimmered down quite a lot. Bengal election, that AMU speech, pandering to Muslims in UP elections... it's just the way I feel. Looks like if you have enough people talking about an issue and the whole thing gets highlighted in international circles, BJP are willing to lick their own vomit, quite unheard of a ""fascist"" government.  This also highlights the hidden power levels of the ""left"" media. They are not as helpless as they want you to think, especially when they are the ones controlling the narrative around the India in the world.

Your CAA-NRC evangelical dream is not coming to fruition.

To summarize, I think the democracy won, and in that process BJP has salvaged itself a bit.",2021-11-19 03:14:51,22

Lastly, although this is a very old post (from June, during Pride month), here's another example of queerphobia in the sub: a parody ""Authright Pride"" flag:

To conclude, RightistVexillology's own rules state, *""No bigotry: Racism, sexism, ableism, transphobia, landphobia, etc. is strictly forbidden""*, but the evidence above would suggest that this is merely a fa√ßade (the 'landphobia' element might also be interpreted as a nationalist statement.)

249,q83aa9,caligalus,"No, Fascism is NOT a form of socialism","There have been multiple claims against socialists that Benito Mussolini's Fascist party was socialist due to Mussolini being an ex-member of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and his party being the sole decision maker on economic policies

This argument has been used to attack socialism through association with Fascist policies. It has also led to confusion, as Fascism is normally associated with far-right-wing views.

**So then what actually is Fascism?**

Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries. Opposed to anarchism, democracy, liberalism, and Marxism, fascism is placed on the far right-wing within the traditional left‚Äìright spectrum.

Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A military citizenship arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war. The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens. Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete and regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. A fascist state is led by a strong leader (such as a dictator) and a martial law government composed of the members of the governing fascist party to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views imperialism, political violence and war as means that can achieve national rejuvenation. The extreme authoritarianism and nationalism of fascism often manifests a belief in racial purity or a master race, usually synthesized with some variant of racism or bigotry of a demonized ""Other""; the idea of racial purity has motivated fascist regimes to commit massacres, forced sterilizations, genocides, mass killings, or forced deportations against a perceived ""Other"".

**Position of Fascism in the Political Compass:**

Most scholars place fascism on the far right of the political spectrum. Such scholarship focuses on its social conservatism and its authoritarian means of opposing egalitarianism. Roderick Stackelberg places fascism‚Äîincluding Nazism, which he says is ""a radical variant of fascism""‚Äîon the political right by explaining: ""The more a person deems absolute equality among all people to be a desirable condition, the further left he or she will be on the ideological spectrum. The more a person considers inequality to be unavoidable or even desirable, the further to the right he or she will be.""

Fascism's origins are complex and include many seemingly contradictory viewpoints, ultimately centered around a mythos of national rebirth from decadence. Fascism was founded during World War I by Italian national syndicalists who drew upon both left-wing organizational tactics and right-wing political views. Italian Fascism gravitated to the right in the early 1920s. Italian Fascism gravitated to the right in the early 1920s. A major element of fascist ideology that has been deemed to be far right is its stated goal to promote the right of a supposedly superior people to dominate, while purging society of supposedly inferior elements. In the 1920s, the Italian Fascists described their ideology as right-wing in the political program The Doctrine of Fascism, stating: ""We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the 'right,' a fascist century."".  Mussolini stated that fascism's position on the political spectrum was not a serious issue for fascists: ""Fascism, sitting on the right, could also have sat on the mountain of the center. ... These words in any case do not have a fixed and unchanged meaning: they do have a variable subject to location, time and spirit. We don't give a damn about these empty terminologies and we despise those who are terrorized by these words.""

Major Italian groups politically on the right, especially rich landowners and big business, feared an uprising by groups on the left, such as sharecroppers and labour unions. They welcomed Fascism and supported its violent suppression of opponents on the left.

**Fascist Economics:**

The Fascist regime created a corporatist economic system in 1925 with creation of the Palazzo Vidoni Pact, in which the Italian employers' association Confindustria and Fascist trade unions agreed to recognize each other as the sole representatives of Italy's employers and employees, excluding non-Fascist trade unions. The Fascist regime first created a Ministry of Corporations that organized the Italian economy into 22 sectoral corporations, banned workers' strikes and lock-outs and in 1927 created the Charter of Labour, which established workers' rights and duties and created labour tribunals to arbitrate employer-employee disputes.  In practice, the sectoral corporations exercised little independence and were largely controlled by the regime, and the employee organizations were rarely led by employees themselves, but instead by appointed Fascist party members. While fascism denounced the mainstream internationalist and Marxist socialisms, it claimed to economically represent a type of nationalist productivist socialism that while condemning parasitical capitalism, it was willing to accommodate productivist capitalism within it. While fascism denounced the mainstream internationalist and Marxist socialisms, it claimed to economically represent a type of nationalist productivist socialism that while condemning parasitical capitalism, it was willing to accommodate productivist capitalism within it. This was derived from Henri de Saint Simon, whose ideas inspired the creation of utopian socialism and influenced other ideologies, that stressed solidarity rather than class war and whose conception of productive people in the economy included both productive workers and productive bosses to challenge the influence of the aristocracy and unproductive financial speculators. Saint Simon's vision combined the traditionalist right-wing criticisms of the French Revolution with a left-wing belief in the need for association or collaboration of productive people in society. Whereas Marxism condemned capitalism as a system of exploitative property relations, fascism saw the nature of the control of credit and money in the contemporary capitalist system as abusive. Unlike Marxism, fascism did not see class conflict between the Marxist-defined proletariat and the bourgeoisie as a given or as an engine of historical materialism. Instead, it viewed workers and productive capitalists in common as productive people who were in conflict with parasitic elements in society including: corrupt political parties, corrupt financial capital and feeble people.  Fascist leaders such as Mussolini and Hitler spoke of the need to create a new managerial elite led by engineers and captains of industry‚Äîbut free from the parasitic leadership of industries. Hitler stated that the Nazi Party supported bodenst√§ndigen Kapitalismus (""productive capitalism"") that was based upon profit earned from one's own labour, but condemned unproductive capitalism or loan capitalism, which derived profit from speculation.

**Fascist Italy:**

Historian Stanley G. Payne says: ""\[Fascism in Italy was a\] primarily political dictatorship. ... The Fascist Party itself had become almost completely bureaucratized and subservient to, not dominant over, the state itself. Big business, industry, and finance retained extensive autonomy, particularly in the early years. The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy. ... The Fascist militia was placed under military control. ... The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders ... nor was a major new police elite created. ... There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience. ... Sizable sectors of Italian cultural life retained extensive autonomy, and no major state propaganda-and-culture ministry existed. ... The Mussolini regime was neither especially sanguinary nor particularly repressive.""

**Fascist aesthetics:**

According to cultural critic Susan Sontag, ""\[f\]ascist aesthetics ... flow from (and justify) a preoccupation with situations of control, submissive behavior, extravagant effort, and the endurance of pain; they endorse two seemingly opposite states, egomania and servitude. The relations of domination and enslavement take the form of a characteristic pageantry: the massing of groups of people; the turning of people into things; the multiplication or replication of things; and the grouping of people/things around an all-powerful, hypnotic leader-figure or force. The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets, uniformly garbed and shown in ever swelling numbers. Its choreography alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing. Fascist art glorifies surrender, it exalts mindlessness, it glamorizes death."". Sontag also enumerates some commonalities between fascist art and the official art of communist countries, such as the obeisance of the masses to the hero, and a preference for the monumental and the ""grandiose and rigid"" choreography of mass bodies. But whereas official communist art ""aims to expound and reinforce a utopian morality"", the art of fascist countries such as Nazi Germany ""displays a utopian aesthetics ‚Äì that of physical perfection"", in a way that is ""both prurient and idealizing.""

&#x200B;

Thus it can be concluded that Fascism is nothing but an ideology that believes in authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy and thereby is in no way related to socialist principles.

Fear of a communist revolution was a major historical factor in European diplomacy. Russia going communist IRL was a BFD that both immediately triggered foreign intervention & dominated European politics up to ww2 (& beyond). In vic2 Russia going communist doesn't affect much outside of Russia.

My thoughts would probably be that a communist revolution should pretty much immediately prompt a diplomatic event, should prompt hostility from capitalist countries and give a communist player decisions to be more nationalist or internationalist. I would also make Fascism more likely to try and press expansionist claims relatively quickly.

Some lobsters are in agreement with Jordan

* [Took him far too long to realize this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h91mlzh/)

* [Well yes, ghettos were a public health measure. Doesn‚Äôt make them right‚Ä¶](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8yjp8z/)

* [We have ZERO idea what effect this vaccine will have in ten years. It could be the new Raditor for all we know.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8z2aq5/?context=10000)

* [Is this what it looks like when the left goes too far?](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8z4d13/)

* [Leave it to JBP to call a duck a duck. Glad he sees through this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8yifnp/)


Other lobsters defect from the pod

* [Wtf JBP antivaxxer now?](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h90xvu3/)

* [Jesus Christ Jordan What the hell are you posting?](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8xhq3m/)

* [Rip Jordan what a stupid post](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8z3oqn/)

* [OK. I've been an admirer of Jordan Petersons message (to a certain extent). To this point. I've been concerned at his supporters, but not willing to say followers=the man. But this is just funking unbelievable pandering to audience, at best. At worst, it's harmful on public health grounds. Letting alone Godwin law being invoked here. I'm done.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8ye0up/)

* [Coming from a man who is so into personal responsibility and making the world a better place, this feels wrong](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8y2phl/)


OP shares their own opinion to start off the debate, citing anything from health journals to [sketchy blog posts](https://drrollergator.substack.com/p/damned-lies-and-vaccine-statistics).

* [I feel like the sarcasm in ""as long as it's good for us"" is hard to miss. It reminds me of the good ol - ""its for your own good"" that is often used in totalitarian regimes. Considering the vaccines dont reduce spread and the virus is thus here to stay, (I highly recommend checking out the case numbers of israel) most measures, such as the vaccine passport, seem to loose all significance. Yet, they remain.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8wozdn/)   

Some debate whether it's okay to risk spreading disease to others

* [Not even remotely the same thing. Drinking and driving is chosing to be operating a vehicle on streets with impaired reflexes and judgement. Not vaccinating yourself is simply not vaccinating yourself. Please try to argue in good faith. I know it's Reddit, but come on.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8ysjuc/?context=1)

* [It's simple. We are not responsible for the health of others. Unless we specifically go out of our way to get someone sick (i.e spitting on them), they need to be responsible for themselves.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8xtbdo/?context=10000)

This patriot does not care that vaccines are approved by the European Medicines Agency

* [I dont give a fuck. We fought a fucking WAR so we don't have to give a shit about Europe.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h9d9p7b/?context=10000)

One lobster presents a rare economic argument against vaccination

* [My own arguments against mandatory vaccination are basically economics one. A good capitalist system needs agents (consumers, us the citizens) being able to choose whatever they want to consume. If that thing is forced on us, and we need to pay for it whatever, that will eventually lead to awful things.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8zhldh/)

SgtButtface's military service is not commended

* [Freedom ain't free man, it's something we all need to sacrifice for, not just the troops. You're welcome for my service by the way.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8xz4wi/)

Other highlights

* [Good logic, if this scamdemic is so serious why let fat and old people outside at all? If people dying is so bad, why don't we flatten the fat, alcoholism and smoking by banning those things? Leftists are just fearful fruitcakes that have no purpose in their lives so they need this phony scamdemic to give them a sense of actually doing something when they sit around and jerk off/watch netflix and cry on the internet.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8yqdaf/?context=10000)

* [""Public health"" is a term that is used to control people not for the benefit of individuals who have diverse interests and risk tolerances but for the power of the state, which ought to be limited and constrained to general welfare, not favoritism for particular groups.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8yi2hu/?context=10000)

* [The CDC said the vaccine does not reduce transmission.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8ynfxk/?context=10000)

* [It really saddens me that there is a big overlap between JBP fans and antivax shills.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h8yul5s/)

Thankfully, a crustacean Canadian constitutional scholar weighs in

* [It violates Canadian charter rights for freedom of movement within Canada. It will probably be challenged in court and take years to resolve, so it's a mute point and is more of a political maneuver for the supposed upcoming election (by the time the courts decide the pandemic may be over).](https://old.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p47t6n/medical_fascism/h90868q/)


**Second Thread** 

**[The next day, Jordan Peterson clarifies that he is double vaccinated](https://i.redd.it/cnaoegbmygh71.png)**

**Someone makes a thread with the tweet titled: ""Stop trying to make him look anti-vaxx. He said for many times that his recommendation is to get vaccinated.

Further debate about vaccine efficacy, mandate and the definition of ""fascism"" continues here. Many do not like being labeled as an ""anti-vaxxer"". 

* [i really hate this. there needs to be a different name the vaxxed call the COVID-vax hesitant.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h923kdp/?context=10000)

* [""Anti-vax"" used to mean people who would never get vaccinated or let their kids get vaccinated because they think vaccines cause autism or something. Now the media paints everyone who isn't in favor of forced injection (a medical decision you and your doctor should make) as ""anti-vax"", completely obfuscating the original meaning of the term. They want everyone who doesn't want medical fascism to be lumped in with ignorant people who know nothing about vaccines.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h929p08/)

* [I don't see why people don't understand you can be hesitant without being anti-vax. I've had dozens of vaccines in my life from birth till a year ago (tetanus booster). I havent gotten this one because its not even done its fucking testing yet. That's a pretty valid reason to not want to get it, I think.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h90xv3y/?context=10000)

TheConservativeTechy argues against the dictionary

* [Heads up that Miriam Webster quietly changed the definition of anti-vaxxer to include people against vaccine mandates. And this is far from the only time these dictionaries have fallen on one side of the political debate.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h91tjxz/)

Some share their reasons for not getting vaccinated

* [All the vaccines are obsolete now anyway.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h90ri31/)

* [Why is the current (wrongly) accepted wisdom that you are somehow protecting others by getting this vaccine?](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h92dmo3/?context=10000)

Government mandated gains

* [So all these people who want to force vaccines on everybody‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôd be okay with the government forcing them to eat healthy and going to gym for an hour everyday? Heart disease is the number one killer of adults in the US after all. No going to restaurants, schools and other public places until you have low cholesterol, six pack abs and a toned butt.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h91hfee/)




This person does not like when people say ""spreading misinformation""

Let's not mindlessly parrot a bit of language intended to discourage free thought and speech, OK?](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h91atl3/?context=2)

Germany's official coronavirus information is totalitarian


* [""trustworthy information sites on the vaccines."" This, this right there is what screams totalitarianism about all this. The usurpation of knowledge, believing to be right when in fact true knowledge is and has always been generated in a decentralised fashion. If the state declares alternate viewpoints as harmful and starts smearing, censoring, cancelling and defaming them in such a way with a simple appeal to authority, it's not the critic that's gone mad, it's society.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h9gynrj/?context=3)







Lobsters are known for having strong immune systems

One has a theory as to why people dislike antivaxxers

* [It‚Äôs because if you‚Äôre questioning something they already did, they then have to think about that and the fact they already did the thing you‚Äôre hesitant about. It‚Äôs too painful for them to think they‚Äôve possibly made the wrong decision, so they scream you‚Äôre anti vax to get you to be like them so they can relax again. Basically, weak minds.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h91hjxu/?context=1)


An anti-vaxx scholar gets philosophical

* [That would depend on your moral. If you refer to deontological ethics and Kant's categorical imperative, it could be immoral to get vaccinated, if you do it merely for the sake of others.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h94xej4/?context=10000)

Somehow, they manage to turn the discussion to trans people **TW: Transphobia**

* [""he [Jordan Peterson] doesn‚Äôt think trans women are women.""
That is because they are not objectively women, but they believe themselves to have become women (female) and appear female to greater or lesser degrees.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h919zjl/?context=1)

This lobster has the solution to climate change

* [The progressive climate change rhetoric is all sound and fury. Not because global warming is a fiction, but because we already have nuclear power as a solution. There are no good arguments against it which would not be doubly applicable to coal-burning plants. Yet progressives insist on wind and solar power. Why? My suspicion is that they don't want workable technology. They prefer Greta Thunberg to Boyan Slat.](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/p4oon5/stop_trying_to_make_him_look_antivaxx_he_said_for/h9133eb/?context=10000)

The Republicans call theirs ""tax-cuts"", Democrats choose ""infrastructure"" or ""stimulus"". These of course are dog whistle terms for corporate business interests. The purpose behind these legislative efforts should be painfully obvious despite the very vague and rosy titles. 

Bonito Mussolini describes this as such: ""Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power."" It seems to me the u.s. has slowly morphed into exactly this type of economy, with efforts from both parties. The saddest part, to me, is how much these shenanigans are met with celebration. Witness a bunch of crooks get together to spend a trillion dollars, how exciting!

He was an iconic player for the London-based football team Tottenham Hotspur during his playing days. He later went on to manage the England national team and Tottenham.  He also is a born-again Christian and believes in reincarnation.

An [article](https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/entertainment/reality-tv/the-masked-singer-grandfather-clock-reveal/) about his footballing career mentions one of Hoddle's biggest regrets. The post that kicked it all off is a comment wondering why Hoddle's biggest regret wasn't his comments about disabled people that got him fired as manager of the England national team.

 r/coys discusses:

> Not getting fired for saying disabled people were being punished for being bad people in a previous life?

User rushes to defend Hoddle claiming his quote was twisted by the Fake News media

> It was a bit more complicated than that though, wasn't it? Expressing a privately held religious belief \(which is shared by half the planet\) when a corrupt journo lied to him about being genuinely interested in his beliefs in a discussion that he was assured was off the record

He also accuses the first poster of secretly being a fan of Tottenham's heated rivals Arsenal

> I can't believe a Spurs fan would relive this muck-throwing episode which set the England football team back a decade. Hopefully you're just a trolling Gooner

After rooting out one of the mutants, he gets in a fight with a bunch of rogues and wins a powerful, mystical weapon of old that makes him King of his People, and from there, he leads the forces of good in a battle against the evil mind-controllers.

Sounds similar to other sci-fi and fantasy stories, right?

Except, what if I told you that the story I described was Adolf Hitler‚Äôs Hugo-award winning sci-fantasy, *Lord of the Swastika*? Because that‚Äôs the major premise of *The Iron Dream*. It pretends to be another book entirely, written by an alternate history Adolf Hitler who emigrated to the US in 1919 instead of becoming Leader of the Nazi Party.

Perhaps fittingly for a story that prefers arming its character with truncheons over swords, the book keeps bludgeoning us over the head with the same message: your sword and sorcery story is uncomfortably fascist. And if that isn‚Äôt enough, it ends with an academic reviewing the book, literally reminding us of the central narrative, by explicitly dissecting how the fictional Hitler is taking your bog standard tropes and turning them up to eleven, whilst swapping out usual fantasy terms of good and evil with eugenics terms. Subtlety is not this book's watchword, and some old copies even resorted to having a motorcycle-riding Hitler on the front cover. (Despite this, some readers didn‚Äôt get the message and it ended up on the American Nazi Party‚Äôs recommended reading list. Go figure.)

Norman Spinrad wrote this book to criticise the militaristic power fantasies that seemed to crop up again and again in books of his time, such as Robert Heinlein and Orson Scott Card. Apparently, he took specific issue against Card's *Ender Game*.

I personally haven‚Äôt read many stories that would fit that narrative. I didn‚Äôt think it was a huge problem anymore, thought most modern authors seemed to have also noticed this and taken it to heart. But perhaps that's because those stories don't appeal to me; there could be plenty and I'm just not seeing them, because I'm ignoring them. And then it occurred to me, what about other media? I know *Starship Troopers* (ironically based on a Heinlein book) doesn't count, because the people who made it were intentionally doing what Spinrad was doing. But some other TV shows, videogames and movies, kind of feature similar elements.

Is Spinrad's book still sadly as relevant now as it was when written?",2021-11-08 04:42:26,92

In 20 years climate change is going to start to really impacting our day to day lives and its only going to get worse after that. Currently we have a growing tide of facisim  and nativism and anti-intellectualism in the country that is just going to get more and more unstable as we get closer to 2024.  Medicare for all, better infrastructure, and other ""socialist"" policies seem like a pipe dream at the moment and the middle class is shrinking each year. 

How do I make it seem like this really matters. I mean yeah I focus a lot on how we got here. Tracing the path of nativism, red scare, conservatism/fundamentalism, and social policies is a big part of my American History class. And yeah I focus on how things have gotten better over time and how important it is to be active politically but when we are facing so many things that are just so much bigger than us and living in a world where most of my students, white or brown, see how flimsy the American Dream really is how do you keep teaching? 

Sure we are teaching more than just history, we are teaching skills like research, writing, forming opinions based on facts, empathy and understanding of other cultures. But when good paying jobs are scarce and global warming will start hitting us when they are in their 30's why does it really matter?

401,qjnv9o,CacheGoldSilverToken,Global Move To Fascism/Communism Is A Crisis And Gold & Silver Is The Best Way To Prep For That,"When most people prep they are thinking about mad max/ anarchy type of situation and it‚Äôs all bullets and food storage etc‚Ä¶Personally I see the next crisis as being a global move towards centralized control and any civil war type thing would be short lived and probably provoked by the authoritarians themselves. Gold and silver gives you the ability to prep for a crisis caused by big government, which tends to create hyperinflation and depressions, and the ability to barter, strategically relocate, and come out on top economically after the period of volatility comes to an end. Historical examples of that too.


Authoritarians love the idea of civil war and things like that. It‚Äôs so obvious they are trying to push people in that direction so they can justify outright martial law at the federal level, push for radical gun control and justify domestic terrorism and cracking down even more on the general population. Look how the police pulled aside the barricade and let in the ‚ÄúJanuary rioters.‚Äù Fucking millions of people protesting but a group of 50 people got all the media attention. Pretty obvious what the game is in my opinion.

That‚Äôs one of my biggest concerns is an apocalypse brought about by a move towards fascism or communism (same thing in my view). Because without the US and Europe bringing some balance to the world, flawed as it is, I don‚Äôt think the current world population can be sustained. We depend on science and constant innovation to solve the worlds problems (overpopulation, energy cliff, pollution, shortages) and you must have the capability to exercise the scientific method and we need constant innovation and constant economic growth in order to sustain this rapid movement of the human population brought about since the industrial revolution. This requires at least some degree of creative thought and objectivity or else we regress to a more primitive state and the population cannot be sustained. You need at least some level of decentralization to have this capability and to avoid total systemic inefficiency brought about by too much centralized control and this global movement towards top-down centralized societies (like what we are seeing in Australia) will be the cause of the next crisis if you ask me. It may play out as economic crisis and shortages and we are already seeing the early stages of that.

The modern world and modern economy can‚Äôt exist without some degree of decentralization and empowerment of the individual and I think this over-centralization and agenda 21 madness has already been showing how quickly authoritarians can start to destroy the world and break down civilization. Authoritarian regimes always begin badly and end badly so strategic relocation and also gold and silver are key parts of prepping‚Ä¶be able to leave the city at a moments notice and wait out a period of volatility near other like minded freedom-oriented individuals. 

Have to protect ourselves economically and store essentials ahead of time so you can maintain your access to essential resources during a crisis without having to rely on centralized systems which will increasingly break down. This enables you to be able to leave the city and stay away from volatile regions. We need to form smaller communities of prepared individuals and utilize all forms of preparedness going forward. Silver and physical cash stored separately allocated in a safety deposit box can be your inroad towards greater purchasing power increase after a period of either deflation (physical cash benefits) or inflation (physical metal benefits over time). Separating yourself economically from counter-party/ bank bail-in risk is essential as well to benefit from depression or hyperinflation scenarios and complete your preparation if unable to do so at the current time!",2021-10-31 06:46:41,238

Here are a few pivotal aspects I can see (or am re-presenting from recent discussions in this subbreddit) to fascism in society and govermentality.

### Group hewing‚Üícleavage arising from making association decisions for others

* Comparing a human (or their performance/behavior) to a standard or rubric without their enthusiastic consent.

* Deciding whether or not someone should be allowed to be part of a group. (Generally executed as a few group owners making a binary decision for the whole group's boundaries.)

* Deciding whether or not someone ""deserves"" your help or your group's services.

* Making these decisions based on the results of the rubric evaluation.

### Building and enforcing the illusion of a separate reality and history

* All public airtime is scheduled and/or dominated by formal enunciations about specified topics

* Unscheduled enunciations are interrupted and dismissed to the private sphere

* Making too many off-topic or unscheduled enunciations will result in falling below the group's standard for membership

### Limited time or resources, or risk or danger, used as excuse for interpersonal and institutional abuse

* ""With limited time, we must all make hard choices about who we spend time with""

* ""With limited resources, we have created five seats, and with only three seats available, we need some kind of standard to determine who will even be considered for final selection, out of respect for our time as evaluators as well. Perhaps evaluators should be paid for their hard work.""

* ""I don't have time to feel my emotions, certainly not yours! I need to get back to work, stay the fuck away from me.""

### Absurd performative contradictions

* ""You are abusive, you fucking nitwit!""

* ""Your emotions are abusive and I hope you burn alive in fire!""

* Installing extremely invasive everyday measures in the name of democracy or respecting others' safety or space. (Measures such as these make everyone feel unsafe and demonstrate a lack of free space.)

### Escalation and withdrawal in response to dissent

* All contradiction of the separate reality met with escalation and/or withdrawal

* Disarmament not usually possible‚Äîwould require removing the grain of sand from the center of the pearl (of fascist ideology).

* Personal boundaries weaponized through aggressive escalation and fantastic extension of boundaries (as seen in the separate reality). (Equivalent to ""I'm punching the air in front of me and walking forwards, I hope no one gets in my way."")

* Extension and reinforcement of the separate reality in service of enhancing the weaponization of personal boundaries. (The greater the threat, the greater the allowable violence of a protective response‚Äîso the threat is enhanced.)

### Detachment in scale between cause and effect, crime and punishment, value and reward

* Made possible by the separate reality, colloquial gaps arise between different areas of life, different steps of process, and different topics and categories. (Different factions are dominant in different areas, and deploy their weaponized boundaries in the areas they dominate to maintain their control of their discursive territory or the public narrative.)

* ""You're making me feel negative emotions right now. If you don't stop I'll attempt to ruin your entire life.""

* ""Those who do not work at an hourly job deserve no food or love.""

* ""Poor people who sell drugs to make ends meet deserve longer sentences than corrupt politicians and executives who steal billions from everyone.""

* ""Anyone who breaks a rule should be held in a concrete tomb until psychologically broken.""

448,ptya5h,BillNyeTheCommieGoi,"""Communism"" has become even more of a buzzword than ""fascism"" in the last year or two.","I was one of those edgelords kids back in 2016 who started falling into the alt-right trap, and I remember a lot of those podcasters or speakers would constantly dunk on the ""Left"" for using fascism to describe anything they don't like. While people certainly overuse the term fascism. I've heard ""Communism"" thrown around so much online and offline by radical conservatives that the word has lost all meaning to me.

First it was the communists who were communists, then the socialists were communists, then the social democrats were communists, then the normal democrats were communists, now any big tech *corporation* is communist. Companies asking people to wear masks on their private property? Communist. McCain, Romney, McConnell, any other Republican who said even one bad thng about Trump? Communist.

I know that communism has been used as a buzzword for a long time now, but recently it feels like we're having another Red Scare with how quick insane accusations are thrown around like candy. 

Corporations, especially large ones like grocers, fast food, pharmaceutical, big tech, etc **CAN NOT** be communist or push a communist agenda. If they truly were, they'd dismantle their assets and dissolve the corporation.

Democrats are an (economically) right wing party, left of the GOP, but not by a considerable amount. The most extreme Social Democrats in government are still center left.
There are no communists in the US government that I know of, and certainly not enough to make any kind of change.

If you really believe the democrats have a socialist or communist agenda, look at the Agenda of an actual communist or Socialist 3rd party and compare. Maybe also look at who's funding the Democrats.

If the Republicans are the party of facts and knowledge, why are so many of their members completely unable to read even a wikipedia definition of the buzzwords they use nearly every day. (Although I've heard from an alt-right acquaintance that the Online Wikipedia is also communist so that's probably why)

In general, calling a multi-billion dollar corporation with thousands of stores built on private land ""communist"" makes you sound like a complete and utter buffoon to anyone with even a highschool-level knowledge of Capitalism v. Communism",2021-09-23 10:57:21,171

>Antifa and its Origins - In his latest, Paul Gottfried explains how ""fascism"" became uprooted from time and place in our political parlance.

Dr. Paul Gottfried (from Yale) & John Vella of TAC is here to explain how fascism has an unfair reputation... and that Mussolini was great before Hitler got to him in 1938? Frightening stuff here...

>Mussolini‚Äôs embrace of German-style anti-Semitism in 1938 was a dramatic departure from longstanding fascist practice. Despite his authoritarianism, Il Duce was considered a leftwing reformer until his alliance with Nazi Germany. Members of his cabinet were vocal critics of Hitler. Only a couple years earlier, Jewish refugees from Germany were given asylum in Italy.

[On Twitter, TAC shared the article as follows](https://twitter.com/amconmag/status/1462118546205466629)

>NEW: ""The antifascist left smears their 'fascist' opponents with the Nazi and anti-Semitic label. However, fascism and Nazism are not identical.""

TAC is a paleoconservative (fascist-lite) organization founded by Pat Buchanan (1).

(1) Pat Buchanan is a fascist who the mainstream media (CNN & MSNBC in particular) normalized for decades. He is a the closest predecessor to Trump policy wise. Rhetorically, Pat is very cordial and he knew how to blow smoke up liberals asses (hence the mainstream media love). Pat has written books defending Hitler, the main focus of his politics was the culture war surrounding immigration.

TAC is on the far-right and is not super mainstream, but this is how Republican fascists successfully have moved us to the brink of civil war. They ""test the waters"" with [their less mainstream outlets like TAC funded by oil companies all the same](https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/contrib.php?cmte=American+Conservative+Union&cycle=2014) and then Trump amplifies it, etc.

This is concerning, that the TAC  publishing pro-fascist articles. Especially since Pat Buchanan is a man dedicated to optics, and he is still active in affairs. So now the Trump people, big oil, etc. are testing the waters iwth pro-fascism articles from Pat Buchanan (bougie fascist careful about optics)... 2022 is madmax? :(",2021-11-22 08:05:40,80

In fact, ""fascist"" seems to be used to denounce someone as a murderous sociopath, much like ""communist"" was used during the Red Scare. 

To be sure, I'm not arguing for the rehabilitation of fascism. It just seems strange to me that both are received so differently when they have a lot of similarities:

* Both are totalitarian ideologies
* Both are millenarian in their aims
* Both condone the use of political violence against enemies
* Both have led to extreme genocide and oppression (Stalinism for communism and Nazism for fascism)

Is is that the atrocities committed in the name of communism are ""bugs"" while those committed under fascism are features? Is there something inherent to communism that makes it more redeemable than fascism? Or have communists just done a better PR job at cleansing their own image?",2021-09-12 16:02:04,94

Everywhere atheism and secularism reigns, equality between women and men is promoted i.e the former USSR, although it was a totalitarian system in its own rights, or China now. But closer to home how Social Democratic and non religious countries like those of Scandinavia show an example of a rational and inclusive as well as equalitarian system.
