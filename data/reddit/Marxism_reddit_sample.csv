Every state engages in censorship in some form or another, and to erroneously suggest that this was (and is) uniquely a 20th(-21st) century communist issue betrays one’s ignorance. That said, the extent and degree to which states exert their powers of censorship must be taken into account, and Marxist-Leninist states rival and triumph over some of the worst countries in the Islamic World in this regard.  

[Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Cuba), [Laos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press_in_Laos), [Vietnam] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Vietnam), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_China) and [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_North_Korea) were ranked, respectively, [171st, 172nd, 175th, 177th, and 179th out of 180](https://files.catbox.moe/mzdk53.jpeg) by Reporters without Border’s [2021 Freedom of Press index](https://archive.md/qTpK6).

> - Gosteleradio, in charge of radio and television broadcasting

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_Soviet_Union

> Virtually every published document, be it a newspaper article or a book, had to pass the censor's approval. The strictness of the censorship varied with time, the tightest being during the Stalinist era of the 1950s

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Communist_Romania

> Library collections were systematically cleansed, the majority of the books destroyed, some isolated in Party or academic libraries. A list of prohibited publications and black-listed writers was created in 1950 during the darkest years of Stalinism in Poland with some 1,682 items, and subsequently modified many times by the communist authorities in the Polish People's Republic.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Communist_Poland

> Content which was considered harmful to the regime, or to communist ideologies in general, was strictly forbidden. The definition of what could be harmful included a number of different categories.

> Negative portrayals of the GDR were censored as well. This included criticisms and complaints about the standard of living and education in the country as well as calling attention to pollution and other problems of the industrial system. Republikflucht, or fleeing the GDR for West Germany or other countries, was not to be portrayed at all, nor was discussion of the Berlin Wall.

**In (unfortunately) extant countries:**

> Cuba has ranked low on the Press Freedom Index from Reporters Without Borders from 2002 when the index was established (134th out of 139)[4] to the present (169th out of 180 in 2015).[5] In 2006 the Inter American Press Association reported that ""repression against independent journalists, mistreatment of jailed reporters, and very strict government surveillance limiting the people’s access to alternative sources of information are continuing"".[6]

> In the past, books, newspapers, radio channels, television channels, movies and music were heavily censored and clandestine printing was highly restricted.[7] Also until recent years, internet access was limited for the vast majority of Cubans [8] and mobile phones were quite rare, with most citizens not having been allowed to use them.[9] In recent years, this has changed with the Cuban public having easy (but often expensive) access to the internet and mobile phones with little apparent filtering taking place.[10]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press_in_Laos

> Despite legal recognition of such freedoms in its Constitution, the exercise of these freedoms in Vietnam is, in practice, significantly constrained by censorship in many areas. Certain topics, especially in relation to political dissidents, acts of corruption by top Communist Party leaders, the legitimacy of the Communist Party, Sino-Vietnamese relations and human rights issues are forbidden topics and are censored in a variety of ways by the Communist Party, including the use of physical intimidation, imprisonment, destruction of materials and cyber-attacks on websites.

> The government has censorship over all media capable of reaching a wide audience. This includes television, print media, radio, film, theater, text messaging, instant messaging, video games, literature, and the Internet. The Chinese government asserts that it has the legal right to control the Internet's content within their territory and that their censorship rules do not infringe on their citizens' right to free speech.[2] Chinese officials have access to uncensored information via an internal document system.

31,qzp18o,Poo-et,CMV: The Marxist labor theory of value doesn't adequately account for fungibility,"Background on me before I explain my thoughts. Social democrat, well versed on Marx and leftist implementation ideas like anarcho-communism and antiwork. Tech startup founder as my day job. I'm aware this isn't a novel line of reasoning, but I've also not yet seen an adequate response

So my startup makes construction software for drastically speeding up project change order management and dispute resolution. I've been contemplating the ethics of my own profit versus our customers (and their workers) and my own employees. I focus on this example because I think we add value in a fairly straightforward way - use us and your margins go up. Assume for a second that there are only 3 parties in this discussion:

1. A perfectly organised workers co-operative construction company

2. Software developers employed by me 

3. Me and my co-founder

The labor theory of value would hold that I'm entitled to more compensation than the others in this equation by a bit. The exact amount can be argued about, but a moderate value probably. Of the revenue the software my company develops generates, the lion's share should be distributed amongst my workers and the workers of the construction company. The question, of course, is to what degree I created that value versus my workers and the workers at the construction company. Certainly, without the labor of the construction workers, my software developers would have no process to make more efficient. Without me, my software developers would likely work on a problem that adds much less value. 

To bring in my title's thesis, the labor theory of value makes a lot of sense for the construction workers. The value of construction is the guys actually on the ground throwing bricks around. The quality and value of the construction project is directly proportional to the amount of people and time spent throwing bricks around. It doesn't require much creativity to know what to do to achieve that value. If someone is stood there siphoning off most of the result, arguably it might well be theft from the workers.

For the software developers, they need a certain amount of creativity to be efficient, but efficient software developers are essentially fungible. What they're building is very very important, and an extremely proficient software developer can produce absolutely no value as the result of a lot of labor in a way that it's much harder for a construction worker to. They're entitled to some stake for sure, but the exact same small development team working on two different problems could revolutionise the world or make something nobody wants. And choosing between ideas is very difficult.

And that brings it to me. I will either make absolutely no money, or boatloads of money, and that result is determined directly by how good the ideas I produce are. The technology to make what my company makes has been around for 20+ years, but nobody has organised a team and gotten to it until now. I'm not inventing the wheel, but I have invented a small, logical progression that makes the construction industry more efficient. 

It remains to be seen whether it actually provides value on a large scale, but whether the result is 1x or 10000x what it is now, the influence rests not much on the construction workers, a little bit on my programmers, and a lot on me. The fact that tiny decisions that don't take me much time but could be the difference between extremely large value and small value is measurable labor doesn't make much sense.

Physical labor creates additative physical value. Work twice as much, produce twice as much value. Value is transparently a function of labor.

Intellectual labor multiplies physical value. The value created by the intellectual is proportional to the amount of physical labor done, but it doesn't require any additional ongoing labor by the intellectual to continue creating that value. It doesn't make the intellectual a parasite to siphon off perhaps 10 or 20% of that additional value. He's not stealing from the laborer, he created a ton of value for the laborer and is taking a cut.

I am more suited with first wave anarchism, working class issues and the like, Butler and Foucault only brushed me at university, can someone explain to me in a nonreductionist way what that means?

Thank you, Jordan Peterson! Also, this is my first Thanksgiving alone! Advice?","[EDIT: I REALIZE NOW NOT TO POST MY FLUID IQ. I tried to edit it out, but i’m not a master redditor. IQ is really what you do with it, as someone said. Sharing my own IQ is embarrassing, to a degree. I understand it may seem like bragging, but please let me explain in the end. Also, I am also very new to Jordan Peterson’s writing, and am just leaving the radical left!]

I suppose that the title says it all. This is my first Thanksgiving alone, and please excuse any poor grammar; I was sent to the Troubled Teen Industry, and never was able to express myself clearly through writing. Proper grammar wasn’t ever my strong suit, but I am working hard on it now!

It’s going to be lonely, but I plan to purchase and read some of the more philosophical books provided as links on Jordan’s website, as I have read most of the books that were in the first category that were generally provided on the first section of the JBP site. I am fine with being alone, just not for such a long period of time (two weeks). Keep in mind, I’m on Rule 1 or 2, emotion-wise.

It is challenging to be a female who has an emotionally unavailable mother. If Jordan is ever to read this, please know I have looked exhaustively for a lecture or thought on an absent mother, and I can’t seem to find one. I’d really like to hear more on your opinion. I see so much that is helpful for a father figure, but none for mothers.

Also, it’s quite frustrating to feel the constant pressure and anxiety surrounding being an agreeable and friendly person, who cannot reveal her true belief systems, bar small (as in very small) groups of friends. I feel as if I am in constant hiding, for fear of being cancelled; at least in terms of losing friends. I am learning with gratitude to stand up for myself. Though, I wonder if this is the time. One the same note: when is the right time?

Most girls I know and love are avid believers of certain movements and post-modern beliefs, and as I have changed, I have come to a horrible thought: I realized recently I might lose all of my friends due to beliefs. I could even lose a contract I’d like to renew should they ‘cancel’ me. That isn’t how friends should work! So, I think I’ll stand back from them for now. 

That’s even tougher, considering the holiday coming up. I don’t want to be completely alone, and fighting against peer pressure as well. Not when feeling so worried and fragile emotionally in this moment. I know I am very strong, but lonliness on a holiday that holds a remarkable amount of importance on me, it does mean quite a bit to challenge my strength.

I cannot go home to my mother, as she is very ill mentally (my unofficial diagnosis would lean towards bipolar or BPD, but I am not a psychologist), and I feel so badly for her; but I have learned to walk away. I have tried so hard to be a good daughter to her, even through the stresses of my first memories being me trying to take care of her through withdrawals. She left me with my father, and that was Hell on Earth. Listening to lectures, though I am very agreeable, I’ve learned to walk — maybe even run — away. Maybe until I’ve matured more.

Sociopaths aren’t exactly fun (nor healthy) to be around for Thanksgiving, either. My father and stepmother, seeing how rebellious I was, promptly had me sent off to an abusive school to “fix” me. I did not need the awful behavior of that school to fix me; I needed a good therapist and perhaps some less detestable punishments from his young wife. I’m very tired of ruminating on it, but the feelings are so upsetting and do cloud my judgement.

I feel, to this day, she was jealous or held
anger towards me, as my father’s wife before him was my beautiful and lovely Korean mother. Even though she has a possible disorder, I will never not praise her for how pretty she was and is. Mind you, I don’t mean this in a catty way. I hope through further explanation I get to the point! Though still young, I was athletic, an avid reader, was a model (and continued until my mid 20’s), and am 50% Asian. Since my father cheated, it seemed like my only deduction through reason was that she saw me as a threat. 

She always told me I would look ugly once I grew up, she did whatever she could to take the wind out of my sails. I wasn’t allowed in Christmas cards, and was often given terribly strange and humiliating punishments. No matter how bad the punishments were by her hand, I took them. Instead of it making me quieter, it made me more rebellious, and more angry, more intolerant. It was her suggestion to have me sent away. So, you might see why I have no plans to see them for Thanksgiving. It’s not productive, even though I do forgive her. It’s not her fault that I became who I became after.

I finally left, graduating with a two-year degree at age 17, then promptly bowed out. I immediately became involved in the wrong group of friends in NYC, modeled, worked, and barely made enough to survive. That’s when pills prescribed came in so handily. I left that scene five years ago, because I was dying. I was starving, broken, and absolutely destroyed. I needed to save myself, and my boyfriend helped me get into a wonderful center and was there every step of the way. I am struggling with Rule #3 on top of 1 and 2, so I might as well stay on 1. 

Now, with so many followers, with so many Marxist friends who don’t seem to follow my sense of logic (or even their own, though I shouldn’t judge), and as someone who has cleaned up my act quite a bit, I’m still anxious to be alone in the home for so long. 

I will be without my boyfriend of five years; he has to leave for business. He cannot sit through a book, but really agrees with JBP’s thoughts. He also concerns me, because there’s been no proposal as of yet (though we do speak often of children, and are finally able to have a home), no matter our level of honesty. I believe in the traditional aspects of marriage, greatly. 

[EDIT: I don’t like lying to someone I love, so we talked about it further! It went very well and I retract my previous worries.]

I actually am quite fearful to put this out, but I don’t know where to go to anymore. I just need some help, and I’d like to thank anyone who reads this. Risking friends who seem so ridiculous wouldn’t matter to me under different circumstances (minor edit: ugh, of course I believe that black people matter, my stepfather was quite literally black! so, i wish my friends wouldn’t waggle their finger at me and say I am a part of the problem, when my only “real” father maybe would not like this!) but I am so scared to say my thoughts. I hope to be sober and kind to myself this Thanksgiving and two-weeks of alone time. It’s time to let my parents go in a way, no matter how much I love them, no matter their actions. 

It really doesn’t help that my therapist (who is helping me through the trauma of my family and to be less agreeable, as I work with complex PTSD) and I discussed having a child, and she told me I could raise it without a gender. I lost my cool. It’s becoming harder and harder. It won’t be long until I cannot conceal that I am tired of being socially forced out for having to abide by every damn rule imposed on me through a cold shoulder. 

I am getting tired of hiding my thoughts (perhaps my biggest mistake), so I thought I might just put them here in haste. They’re a bit scattered, but I’d really appreciate anyone who would and could give me a few reading or movie suggestions, advice, or sense or community. I will buy some more books and leave social media for a bit.

I also think it’s time to reconsider my friends, AGAIN.

Considering contacting Jordan to speak to break this silence after some time, considering so many aspects of where my map of life might lead me. I’m excited to continue learning. I am still listening to lectures and podcasts while reading, so I am new to the
game. Still need some major catching up, but first step, here we go!

Extra: I am also terrified, that through drug usage, I am now about as smart as a can of beans. This is why I brought up my IQ. Is that very bad? I’m not the most booksmart person (used to be! can’t wait to be once
more!), but I usually try to speak and write clearly. 

[Edit: I now know it does go down with age and am working on making sure I do everything I can to work on this. I hope to be a psychologist, when I enroll in school. Maybe even a school counselor. The past two years my job has been as an assistant for “Big Name Insurance”, we’ll call it. It’s not what I want, as I love helping people.

Also, I’m not taking down that modeling was a main/huge source of income in my life. It’s a huge stressor, I still have a contract to renew in a year. If you have trouble with that, I don’t really care. You’re entitled to think I’m lying, as much as I think I have no reason to. It’s my first time posting on here, and really my second-ish time on Reddit. Why would I want to lie on Jordan Peterson’s little corner of the internet, where he might see me? I’d be scared as fuck to lie! Imagine lying where he looks? I look up to him and admire him! 

Of course, with years of modeling under my belt, I definitely do look for external validation, I recognize that. That is how my job worked, and maybe this is a great lesson. I’m taking that positively, actually. I cried a little, and I felt weak and knocked down to size; but I also realized I should order better books, and eat fuckin’ dinner! Stop being so pissed or sad towards my family! My life is comfortable and nice right now, even if I know the 1st Thanksgiving and Christmas without my family will be tough. Life is likely to be full of suffering, in any person’s experiences. Pain is very relative, I’m sharing some of mine; maybe even oversharing, but I feel okay posting this anonymously. That, at the very least, mentally it’s relieving to leave the far left and stop virtue-signaling all of the time.

For more clarification, I wanted to say I don’t know what girl doesn’t want a nice wedding. Idk. Go figure. I just don’t want a courthouse one. I even have my hair accessories finished and a Hanbok picked for the after party. I’m allowed that desire, and I hope to get it.

I’m not gonna defend myself over and over for the modeling aspect or my family! That is unproductive and conjecture on a subject that was only to provide context. Other models can really bully other girls, I’m sure one might relate to that. Poking holes in every aspect of my actual life is really helpful for no one, because I cannot prove it to you without revealing who I am. Criticism, I do not mind. Advice, same there. All I wanted here was to find some people who knew more, and could help me around some of what I’m dealing with, or recommend me cool stuff to do.

44,qsin5i,PainGreat4612,"As a marxist-leninist, I'm struggling to form an opinion about gun ownership, and if anyone could give me an insight about it, I would be really thankful","Before you downvote, I have to say that in the current moment that I'm writting this, I don't have a formed opinion on that subject. That's why I'm making this post, I'm not pro-gun nor anti-gun. This subject is confusing to me and I feel like I don't understand enough about it to take a postion. I am here just to educate myself about it

As I said, this is a very shaky subject to me personally. I'm very confused and I don't know how to feel about this. Because during a part of my life, at times in wich I was significantly less politicized and less radicalized than I am today, I have heard preety compelling arguments against the pro-gun movement that I agreed with. And at that time I have always seen this whole pro-gun things as right-wing talking point. Like, in 2018, in the election campaign of the current president of my country (wich is openly and proudly a fascist), the main thing he defended was the right of gun ownership for every citizen that could afford a gun (more or less like in the United States), wich is something that is strictly prohibited in my country, and when he started saying this kind of thing, a big part of the left in my country went heavily against him, and massive leftist campaigns against gun ownership arised. So, even tough I knew less than the bare minimum about politics at that time, at least I had a vague sense that being a leftist meant being also anti-gun too.

But I had this notion of things years and years ago. Things have changed. Since then I have became more and more radicalized to the left and more engaged in marxist-leninist spaces, and when I started to really get into these marxist-leninist spaces, not just I discovered that Marx himself was pro-gun, as there are plenty of communists who are also pro-gun out there. The main argument they had was that ""the proletariat must be more armed than the bourgeoisie"", and there's also this very famous quote from Marx saying:

“Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary”

and honestly? this argument feels somewhat compelling to me, and I totally understand that. I mean, there is no way we could ever make a revolution without guns anyway, so I agree with that point. But also, I'm having a really hard time trying to ignore the other arguments against the pro-gun movement that still feeling compelling and reasonable to me. Like the fact that it would probably increase considerably the numbers of mass shoothings and murders in general. So I am in that awkward situation of ""I agree with both sides and because of that I'm struggling to form an opinion and take a position"", and I feel like an asshole for having this kind of tought, like, I feel like i'm betraying the marxist-leninist movement or being some kind of centrist, and I don't wanna feel like that.

So, going straight forward to the point, I'm making this post here because I want to take a position on that subject, and the best way that I could think of doing it is by trying to listen to others people perspective on the topic, and see what feels more correct to me.

David Graeber's posthumous book with David Wengrow, 'The Dawn of Everything' is really important for the left. It is inspiring and leaves the reader believing in human emancipation. Dozens of early civilisations speak to our ability to live rich and sophisticated lives without a ruling elite.

But because it shows that massive cities existed in pre-history *before* widespread agriculture it completely undermines the notion of 'Primitive Communism' and there are a lot of Marxists who are going to find it hard to accept, despite the overwhelming evidence it presents.

72,pw38cv,IcyObligation9232,Once again: Every Marxist regime had extremely restrictive gun laws. Don't listen to /r/socialistra's bad faith lies and gaslighting.,"I've been continuing to see a lot of /r/socialistra users on here arguing that the USSR or Maoist China was actually ""pro-gun"". So I decided to look up the laws of various Marxist regimes regarding the private, individual ownership of arms.


**The USSR**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control_in_the_Soviet_Union

>On December 12, 1924, the Central Executive Committee of the USSR promulgated its degree ""On the procedure of production, trade, storage, use, keeping and carrying firearms, firearm ammunition, explosive projectiles and explosives"", all weapons were classified and divided into categories. Now the weapons permitted for personal possession by ordinary citizens could only be smoothbore hunting shotguns. The other category of weapons were only possessed by those who were put on duty by the Soviet state; for all others, access to these weapons was restricted to within state regulated shooting ranges.

So everything was banned for civilians except double-barrel fudd shotguns. 

**China**: https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/131690NCJRS.pdf
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/little-gun-history/

>Many of the articles in the 1951 Measures were designed to identify and gain control of the large number of guns which were within the borders of China at the time as a result of the long 
period of civil war that ended with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) victory in 1949. There was a provision that public security organs [police] on a local level take inventory of all the guns 
in the area, so that permits could be issued to those authorized to have guns (art. 15). Aside from military personnel, officials of a certain rank who needed firearms for their duties who obtain 
permission from the next higher level supervisors could receive authorization to carry guns, as could privately operated enterprises that applied for permits and were approved (arts. 7 & 10). Any 
individual, group, or enterprise possessing a gun at the time that did not receive authorization was to surrender the weapon to the local people's government (arts. 9 & 10). Anyone carrying a gun 
had to obtain a permit stating the name of the bearer, his or her age, sex, place of birth, occupation, and residence, plus information about the gun, including its serial number (art. 11). 
Guns could not be lent, given as a gift, or exchanged (art. 13). Only state authorized factories could make or repair firearms (art. 2).

>The Security Administration Punishment Act of 1957 took the additional step of making it illegal to make, purchase, or possess firearms or ammunition without the government’s permission

**North Korea**: https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20120806002600315

>Under the regulations, guns are allowed only for its ""primary purposes"" including executing official duties such as keeping guard and training.

>Institutions, businesses, groups and the public are prohibited from possessing or transacting firearms according to the law, which also banned lending, smuggling, destroying and self-producing firearms.

**Vietnam**: https://i2i.org/wp-content/uploads/IP-5-2017_c.pdf

>In Vietnam, it's illegal for civilians to own firearms other than shotguns, and those can be held only under restrictive regulations

>The general rule is that only the military and certain law enforcement organizations may possess arms. “Sporting weapons” and “rudimentary weapons” may be possessed by sports training organizations that receive a permit from the government. Private citizens not serving in the military are not allowed to use any kind of firearm other than shotguns. applying for the government license to own a shotgun must provide valid reasons (for example, hunting) and be at least 18 years old. 

I couldn't find the exact laws for Cuban laws. If one has the exact laws I'd appreciate it.

**Albania** (which is constantly cited as a leftist ""pro-gun"" society):
 
The only mention of its gun laws regarding private individual ownership at that time was [here.](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-european-nation-with-a-deadlier-gun-culture-than-the-us-albania/)

>In the years of Communist rule after the end of World War II, both firearms and the Kanun were rigidly prohibited, and guns all but disappeared from daily life.

I use “Marxist” in quotes because I can’t think of a better term, since one can be an anarchist and a Marxist, communist, socialist etc. I suppose tankie but I’m aware that some workers parties reject the term themselves.

For me, I could not see how the state would cease to exist, even eventually. Marx’s understanding of the state is that it is the apparatus with which one class oppresses another. It seems to me that most “Marxists”believe in a stratified party, which I can only see reproducing itself, creating class society. Now I can only really call myself an anarchist, as I don’t have a specific preference - I think there are many ways to effectively operate as an anarchist society.

And what change? More unarmed white people are killed by police. White people are also the number one victims of interracial violence.

Tony Timpa and Daniel Shaver happened before George Floyd. The killings were on par or even more brutal and the cops got off.

They can point to numerous scientific achievements, the rise of China as a potential superpower, the ""[liberation](https://libcom.org/library/vietnam)"" of Vietnam, defeating the Nazis, defeating Japan, defeating European empires, the Black Panthers, massive improvements in public health, huge industrialisation campaigns, enhancing education, expanding women's rights and so much more. Controlling something like 1 in 5 governments at one point and 1/3rd of the global population.

What can we point to? Punk music? Food not bombs? A handful of territories in civil wars that collapsed in less than the amount of time it takes to finish high school - the last of which died before the Holocaust? Radical bookstores? How many people know about r/EZLN or r/Rojava compared to say, the Soviet Union or China or Cuba?

From this perspective, it can be easy to see why more anarchists defect to Marxist-Leninism than vice versa. But I'd like to critique this understanding a little as Marxist-Leninists *are often more ignorant of their own history* than we are. Ignorance of history is not a bad thing, but to be ignorant of history and act with their level of confidence about understanding history is.

Broadly speaking, there have been around 31 countries that have had Marxist-Leninist or Maoist governments at some point. With an associated Wikipedia link (to give a general introduction and just to prove they exist, not to provide commentary on their merits or flaws) this is a list of them in alphabetical order: [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Afghanistan), [Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Socialist_Republic_of_Albania), [Angola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Angola), [Benin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Benin), [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Bulgaria), [Burkina Faso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sankara), [Cambodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Kampuchea), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China), [Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_the_Congo), [Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba), [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovak_Socialist_Republic), [East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany), [Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Democratic_Republic_of_Ethiopia), [Grenada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Revolutionary_Government_(Grenada)), [Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Sékou_Touré), [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_People%27s_Republic), [Laos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos), [Madagascar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Ratsiraka), [Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic), [Mozambique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Mozambique), [Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal), [Nicaragua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Revolution), [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea), [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_People%27s_Republic), [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Romania), [Seychelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France-Albert_Ren%C3%A9), [Somalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_Democratic_Republic), [South Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen), [USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union), [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam) and [Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia). 

Even if we exclude any discussion about the internal operations of these states, just looking at them on a timeline reveals some very interesting things.

For starters, we can see ""waves"" of Marxist-Leninist revolutions happening. The first being 1917 - 1922, where you get the USSR and Mongolia. The second being 1943 - 1949, where you get Albania, Bulgaria, China, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, North Korea, Poland, Romania, Vietnam and Yugoslavia. The third being 1967-1969, where you get the Congo, South Yemen and Somalia. The fourth and final one being 1973-1979, where you get Afghanistan, Angola, Benin, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Grenada, Laos, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nicaragua and the Seychelles, along with the reunification of Vietnam. The only ones that lie outside any of these waves are Guinea (1954), Cuba (1959-1960), Burkina Faso (1983) and Nepal (2005?).

Nepal is pretty controversial, I've never seen an ML online praise it and most regard it as liberals with red flags (Nepal retains a commitment to liberal democracy and capitalism, for now). Meaning the last ""true ML"" revolution was Burkina Faso in 1983, making Sankara the ""youngest"" revolutionary. This means that for all their talk of ""pragmatism"" and ""strategy"" they largely haven't been able to replicate their Cold War era of great success into the modern age. I personally believe this is due to 3 factors:

1. Growth of liberal democracy - you know how MLs like to pull Parenti's line that all the ML countries emerged from dictatorships and therefore can't be criticised for human rights violations since they aren't any worse than what came before? *That's a damn good argument against Marxist-Leninism*. They are yet to prove themselves able to conquer liberal democracy (as are we, but many reasons I believe anarchists are better equipped to do so in the future).
2. Decline of non-settler colonialism - most Marxist-Leninist states form as reactions to fascism and non-settler colonialism. There's also never been a successful Marxist-Leninist revolution in a settler colonial state (to my knowledge)
3. Loss of an interventionist socialist superpower - China actively subverts and antagonises leftist movements in the Global South.

This isn't just me rambling, lots of old ML groups are converting to more anti-authoritarian and social democratic structures. The governments in Angola and Mozambique now endorse social democracy. The EZLN and Rojava are led by ex-MLs and the article ""[The Growth of Anarcho-Syndicalism in Bangladesh](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/bangladesh-anarcho-syndicalist-federation-the-growth-of-anarcho-syndicalism-in-bangladesh)"" provides further evidence to this being a global thing.

One can also critique them on the fact that between 1989 and 1992, Marxist-Leninist governments ended in 21 countries. Or about 2 in 3 of their projects failed in a rapid time-span. Before that, their systems failed in Grenada (1983), Guinea (1984) and Burkina Faso (1987) due to military coups and in one case a US invasion. Far from their cry that ""socialism doesn't work, in practice the CIA sabotages it"" most of the collapses have no evidence of CIA involvement, and the country that has recieved arguably the most CIA sabotage (Cuba) has still survived, suggesting CIA involvement might be good for Marxist-Leninists due to the [rally 'round the flag effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect). Seychelles ended it's Marxist-Leninist government in 2004 and 6 continue to have Marxist-Leninist governments today. 

The time between now and the last ""true"" ML revolution (38 years) is greater than the time between the Russian and Chinese revolutions (32 years), and the Chinese revolution and the victory in the Vietnam War (26 years). There's no real sign they've updated their strategies, and I'm not gonna go into how unsuccessful ""peoples wars"" usually are.

Workers receive their wages almost immediately (or at least typically within 2 weeks of their labor). The firm, on the other hand, needs to wait for their products or services to be sold.

In Marx's theory it is postulated that the workers can ""have it both ways"" so to speak.

They would be earning the full future value of their output before it was sold, ignoring the fact that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

What I am of course referring to is the time value of money. I understand many of you may advocate for the abolishing of money, let's just assume it to mean anything that determines the value of something, whether that be labor tokens or anything else.

In Marx's postulation, workers should be compensated for revenues they have not yet earned. This is why we have wages, a worker's labor has value, but it cannot be equivalent to the future value of their output.

116,qhkceq,kennylala,My first public encounter with Post modern/Neo-Marxists,"Hello all. Before I share my newfangled experience that occurred just 20 minutes ago, I feel that it is best to give some context. I’m a first year law student in a leading Russell group university in London, which is currently planing a teacher strike for various different reasons that I will detail. In their leaflet that lists the aims and targets of the strike, it was particularly emphasised that “coloured women are paid X % less than white men”, “white men get paid X % more than women” etc…. I was particularly wary of these statements so I had emailed the strike’s coordinator and the data i was provided with was indeed a univariate analysis of median pay between said groups.

In todays law seminar, our relatively young (and very liberal) professor decided to discuss this particular point with the class, that just so happens to be comprised of me and 8 female activists. The usual slander of ‘white men’, talks of ‘white privilege’, ‘systemic sexism’; I would describe myself as a person who is opinionated, but i have only ever had intellectual conversations regarding sensitive topics like these with my closest friends and peers. Despite the daunting prospect of immense backlash and verbal violence, I decided to speak out against them, highlighting the divisive nature, identity politics, and inaccuracies of their narrative. Retrospectively, i was patient and didn’t stumble over my words, yet I was still ridiculed, labelled uneducated (despite providing numerous studies and logical arguments i had recited in my shower debates). One of these attacks implied the idea that I was working actively against the wellbeing of my people, as I’m considered an ‘ethnic minority’ in this country. This really hit me hard.

I’m honestly slightly distraught, shell shocked if you will, as it is my first time being ‘mobbed’ like this. I need some advice. 

I’m struggling to see how in one of the world’s top universities, in a subject that is respected, characterised by logic and thoughtfulness, could have such students that bear so little respect to those of a different opinion; although the professor was respectful (relatively), she did not intervene when i was being ideologically mobbed. I’m struggling to fathom with the idea that I might be alone (intellectually), with no room for any of the meaningful discussions I’ve had in the past. Practically, I’m struggling to see how i could reconcile my relationship with that professor and not completely jeopardise my grade for this module.",2021-10-28 05:53:52,70

For this reason, the Social Democratic movement cannot allow the erection of an air-tight partition between the class-conscious nucleus of the proletariat already in the party and its immediate popular environment, the nonparty sections of the proletariat.
Now the two principles on which Lenin’s centralism rests are precisely these:

The blind subordination, in the smallest detail, of all party organs to the party center which alone thinks, guides, and decides for all.

The rigorous separation of the organized nucleus of revolutionaries from its social-revolutionary surroundings.

Such centralism is a mechanical transposition of the organizational principles of Blanquism into the mass movement of the socialist working class.
In accordance with this view, Lenin defines his “revolutionary Social Democrat” as a “Jacobin joined to the organization of the proletariat, which has become conscious of its class interests.”
The fact is that the Social Democracy is not joined to the organization of the proletariat. It is itself the proletariat. And because of this, Social Democratic centralism is essentially different from Blanquist centralism. It can only be the concentrated will of the individuals and groups representative of the working class. It is, so to speak, the “self-centralism” of the advanced sectors of the proletariat. It is the rule of the majority within its own party.""

The effects of these two systems are, furthermore, strictly equivalent. Just like unrestrained economic liberalism, and for similar reasons, sexual liberalism produces phenomena of absolute pauperization . Some men make love every day; others five or six times in their life, or never. Some make love with dozens of women; others with none. It's what's known as 'the law of the market'...Economic liberalism is an extension of the domain of the struggle, its extension to all ages and all classes of society. Sexual liberalism is likewise an extension of the domain of the struggle, its extension to all ages and all classes of society.”*

-------

The ideas here may seem radical to you, but I ask you to keep an open mind. At the very least, it's a break from the constant IDPOL posts, and no, Incels are not IDPOL because nobody chooses to be Incel, and everyone wants to escape from the categorisation.

Some of you will be unfamiliar with the Incel problem, or don't think that looks or sex matters, and that someone can magically improve their outlook and mental health independent of material conditions. If you believe in the bourgeoisie, romantic bootstrap theory, I ask you to read an earlier post I made here that generated some good discussion, [Incels Reloaded: A second look through the lens of Socialism and Compassion](https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/mbyhcr/incels_reloaded_a_second_look_through_the_lens_of/).

Incels are here, they live among us. They're not monsters like the media make them out to be, but victims of a system that favours factors beyond their control such as good looks, and height. This situation has only gotten worse with the advent of online dating, and [sexual selection by women skewing more and more towards the top percentile of men](http://robslink.com/SAS/democd74/okc_rating_curve.htm). [The data trends are not improving, and Incel numbers are only increasing.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2767063) 

When Marx and Engels wrote Das Kapital and the Communist Manifesto, they were deploring the disparity in material conditions, and the *artificial scarcity* that the Capitalist System creates. 
He developed the concepts of Practical Materialism, and Historical Necessity. Marx rightly perceived that the Human mind and consciousness were grounded in, and part of the material world. 
Under this view, is there really a meaningful distinction between so called ""emotional needs"", and physical needs? The emotional IS the physical. 

I've already discussed [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html), and shown the importance of sex and affection to lead a meaningful productive life. The fact that Incels from the developed world routinely kill themselves tells us that their so called emotional needs were far more important than the physical necessities that sustain life. Indeed, many would gladly live lives of impoverishment if it meant their emotional needs were fulfilled.

What then, is the solution? Can we rationally arrange society to push back on millions of years of evolutionary pressure so that that mate selection doesn't primarily occur on the basis of sexual attraction? Perhaps we can inhibit the parts of our brains that evaluates faces, and evaluate each other as individuals on personality alone like in the Ted Chiang's, Liking What You See: A Documentary. While this might be a far off solution that generations in the future could contemplate, is there anything that can be done today? 

One answer here could be, volunteers. There is already a direct precedent to this with [White Hands](https://youtu.be/HErf4OELzYk) in Japan, and [Touching Base](https://www.touchingbase.org) in Sydney, Australia. These are non-profit organisations that provide, or connect sexual services to Down Syndrome, or disabled individuals. 

Here is an expert from the Mission statement and vision of Touching Base:

In acknowledging that **sexual and physical intimacy are core to the human experience**...Touching Base supports the intrinsic right of people with disability, including older people with disability, to sexual expression and physical intimacy...Touching Base seeks to diminish the barriers that people with disability, including older people with disability, experience in accessing the sex industry.

Now while Touching Base merely connects paid sex workers to disabled people, White Hands in Japan appears to be a purely voluntary act where women help men who are Down Syndrome or have Cerebral Palsy to find sexual relief.

You might say that Down Syndrome men are not the same as Incels, but in the sense that they're unable to find sexual intimacy organically, they are the same. There is the same physical necessity, grounded in the material world. 

People already give and volunteer, even when it's potentially to their detriment. They give their own blood, plasma, and platelets for free, which also has its opportunity costs. Volunteer firefighters risk their own lives to save people they don't even know. These people are rightly considered heroes.

What about sexual firefighters? In a world without sexual taboos, that acknowledges the necessity of sex and intimacy, women that voluntarily slept with Incels would be considered heroes providing an indispensable, priceless service to the world.
 
You might object that they can already sleep with escorts, and indeed many do to cope. But the money acts as a psychological barrier between them, and their acceptance by another human being. This conditional factor is a constant reminder of their inadequacies, of their failure as human beings.
Should this be a purely voluntary act, they will know that some humans still accept them despite the circumstances of their birth. That their needs and pain really is acknowledged, and this disparity in luck is being taken into account by compassionate human beings. 

Let me reiterate here that this will be purely on a volunteer basis. We don't look down on people that don't give blood, or people that don't volunteer to be firefighters. Those that do give of their time and resources are acknowledged however for their service. This isn't men feeling entitled to women, but a gift freely given in compassion to help out another in need. [A subreddit here already did a campaign along these lines years ago, where verified girls were encouraged to have sex with virgins.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidslutsclub/comments/66aci9/the_virgin_challenge_yep_just_like_it_sounds/) 

Is this idea really so crazy? Are there real barriers to this beyond taboos around sex? I believe this is nothing more than an application of Practical Materialism, and as Class Consciousness increases, so too will Incel Consciousness.

138,qjkx5x,N0nPolitical,I have compiled a list of arguments by Right wing against the traditional 'Marxist' Indian History narrative. Want your opinions,"I have compiled this list from different right wing (RW) websites like Quora, Dharmadispatch, SwarajyaMag, etc. Just to make sure you don't misunderstand me, I am not claiming anything below here (I am bad at History be it Left or Right). I have just compiled a list of accusations. 

1. Romila Thapar (RT) and Harbans Mukhia says Hindu kings used to regularly destroy temples for looting. Instance: Rajatarangini. Right wing says there is no evidence for any kind of 'regular' or 'frequent' destruction of temples in pre-Islamic India.

2. RT justifies atrocities done by Islamic invaders like Mahmud Ghazni by saying that Aryans (North Indians/brahmins) were invaders too and that Hindu kings before him has also done invasions. RT makes Ghazni look secular by saying that he did not plunder because of Islam but for monetary and other political reasons.

3. RT claims Yudhisthir's remorse could have been modeled from Asoka but RW says that Mahabharata was written much before Asoka so it could not have happened.

4. RT claims upper caste people in ancient India committed atrocities against lower caste people. RW asks why, then, was there no civil war by lower castes in ancient India.

5. RT credits INC solely for Indian independence when RW says there were many people (local heroes) not affiliated with INC who contributed to Indian independence.

6. RT propagates Aryan Invasion/Migration Theory which she herself admits, as per RW websites, have no archeological evidence and has been apparently 'debunked' by DNA analysis. The question of Aryan invasion has also been called 'meaningless' by RT but RW says that AI(M)T forms the basis of Dravidian nationalism so it can't be called meaningless.

7. Traditional knowledge says Harappan civilization predates Vedic civilization but N. Jha and N.S. Rajaram claims to have proved that Harappan civilization was Vedic. RT brought M. Witzel and Steve Farmer to personally attack Jha and NSR according to them.

8. Personal attacks against Thapar by RW because Thapar personally attacks RW: Thapar's clan started with Bahadur Behari Thapar who apparently supported Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. Then General Pran Nath Thapar was responsible for India's loss against China in 1962 (acc to RW: read Himalayan blunder by him)

9. S L Bhyrappa, a Prof of Philosophy, was called during a Committee for NCERT History syllabus under Mrs. Gandhi, who recalls that G Parthasarathy saying that children in India should not be taught 'useless facts' like Islamic invasions and atrocities because it will be harmful for the nation's integrity.

10. RT says that there are stories of Kavashaka and Satyakama where there were atrocities but according to RW, Vedic society was against social stratification and exclusion beyond normal hierarchy.

11. There were instances of spiritual equality as per RW: a Kavashaka, taunted for being born to a dasi woman, summoned river Saraswati. Ravidas summoned Ganga. Sreedara Iyyavaal made Ganga flow out of his well, etc. RW claims these are overlooked in Indian History.

12. RW claims Thapar follows Eurocentric Marxist model (one site claimed she follows Althusser's theory) where dissent is traced to a group/ideology and set against another. For RT its 'brahminical v non-brahminical'. RW says such European theories don't apply to complex ancient Indian societies.

13. RTI filed by RW for seeking evidence behind claim that Mughals destroyed temples but then repaired after the wars were over (Date: 3.9.20, Reg: NSERT/R/E/20/00324). No information was available on this, replied RTI. (the pic of the document was available publicly so I shared the Reg no)

14. It is said that ancient Indians used to consume beef but RW denies that.

15. RW asks: if Aryans were migrants, why do we find traces of settlements before 3000BC along Saraswati river?

16. RT claims Mahabharata and Ramayana were written during 400BC - 400CE by multiple authors. But Mahabharata has, RW claims (I remember physicist Subhash Kak once talking about this), astronomical evidence that dates back to 3100BC. S.R.Rao found Dwarka which traditional Historians ignore. And apparently, End of last Glacial period is the same as end of Treta Yuga, therefore RW claims Vedas and Puranas are accurate descriptions of History.

17. RT claims Ram was a prophet like Muhammad but later claimed to be God to compete with Shaivites. There is also, RW says RT says, a Muslim version of Ramayana which contains Ram and Fathima.

18. Ashoka converted to Buddhism 2 years before Kalinga War but RT, RW accuses, suppresses it to portray Ashoka in a positive light.

19. RT doesn't know Sanskrit at all, so RW says RT should not talk about ancient India since most of ancient Indian literature was in Sanskrit. Another thing that RW claims is that there has not been much archeological research on ancient India and that there are only 20 Universities in the entire India that offers a course on it. According to them, RT, RS Sharma, Bipin Chandra, Habib, etc. are monopolising the ancient History narrative.

As I said earlier, I am not any expert on History and have just compiled a list of accusations that Right Wing makes against traditional Historical narratives. I am in no way endorsing any side when it comes to History and would like a fruitful discussion (you don't have to engage with all the points) on this.",2021-10-31 03:03:00,23

I believe Materialism is not necessary for the discussion and improvement of economic conditions. I myself hold a tentative ontology closer to Heidegger. The human (economic) condition can be improved without having to adhere to a materialist ontology, and Marxist critiques are useful in that project. However, such an understanding cannot be called ""Marxist"" per se, as that term presupposes Materialism, or does it not? I am totally unaware of the philosophical discourse surrounding Marxism btw, so this might by no means be new. Just want to know if other people have thought about this and what has been said regarding this.

When I think of a true Marxist revolution; I think of unions of working people coming together to topple capitalism through militias and establishing communism, shifting power from the hands of the government to the hands of the people,  therefore getting rid of hierarchy that is intrinsic within a capitalist system. I always thought Marxism aims to dissolve the state so working people are free to practice direct democracy in the economic planning within their communities, work towards abolishing money, guaranteeing natural human rights and so forth. Howcome Marx and many Marxists seem to hate anarchists even though they have the same goal? Why wouldn’t Marx like anarcho syndicalism if he believed in dissolving the state anyways? Are all Marxists fans of the USSR and so called “communist countries” or do some think this was an abuse of the term Marxism because it created a ruling class of nobles that took food and weapons from working people, deported ethnic minorities and killed off people trying to practice communism like the black army?

143,r1p67d,wptransplant,Do Marxist understandings of culture/morals show that they are relative or universal?,"I might be a bit off because I was contrasting two ideas in my mind and wanted a bit of clarity.

The first was Noam Chomsky on moral relativism. He says that morals are objective, that progress exists, and that morality is a scientific question akin to a visual system that has a range of variability but has a certain innate structure, and that argumentation can answer moral questions.

The second was Mao’s theory about the base structure of the economy and its interrelation to culture/ideology, and how the economic system gives rise to moral views.

My intuition is telling me that Marxism is morally realist, but is simply showing that some moral views are incorrect (incorrect because they’re shaped the wrong way)—that it’s morally realist in that it takes certain assumptions (that exploitation is bad) in a similar way to Aristotle (that there are good things life should be tied to).

I guess I’m just wondering, does demonstrating that ideology is culturally generated imply moral relativism, or not? Or can you say, “culture generates moral views, but there’s a biological range, and they can be overcome with critical thinking, so therefore morality is objective”?",2021-11-24 23:38:41,19

In large part you could make the argument that Bukharin and the Right Opposition has influenced Deng Xiaoping thought and the course that modern China has taken over the past 50 years, so why continue to support Stalin who would go on to purge the Right Opposition after they were closely allied against the Left Opposition alongside with ""abolishing"" the NEP?",2021-11-29 14:00:28,0

Also, the focus on women's liberation was fairly convenient for the ruling class as they could have a greater pool of people to draw from and pay half the wages (in time) as both sexes were meant to work. Now it's got to the point where people can hardly afford to live if they aren't sharing rent.

I also wonder if there is a link between the decrease in unionisation, the decrease in wages and the proliferation of feminist ideas within university and popular culture.

In response to the recent outbreak of uncalled for secession, and the foreseeable bloodshed that would be wrought under conflict, the Thiggagradian Worker's Councils have decided to declare armed neutrality amidst this crisis. We (the city councils) are in support of an independent Marxist project, but a project which must be wrought by popular consent, and not at the behest of a power hungry governor. 

Thiggagrad still remains loyal to the Authleft party, but also remains loyal to the proletarians of Red Province and their valued lives to spread the revolution. Good revolutionary people should not be thrown towards their fellow revolutionaries, but should remain vigilant together against the Capitalist threats abroad. This is why we choose not to fight the Secessionists, but also not to join in their offensive conflict.

Furthermore, we will not be accepting the deployment of foreign militaries in our territory. No Monke Militia, no Yellow Army, and no combative/antagonistic troops will be tolerated. We will be accepting aid from members of the Authleft Party and their currently held territories to defend against attack should the Secessionists choose barbarism, and to maintain the sovereignty of Thiggagradian people from foreign militias whom might wish to gain foothold in our territory.

This conflict must end, for the good of the revolution.

Love, Secretary MaoMaoMeadows

198,qta7a5,ScreenExtensions,Biden’s Marxist currency nominee Saule Omarova said that all private bank accounts should be taken over and controlled by the Federal Reserve.,"
Saule Omaraova is the most radical and extreme nominee ever pushed forward by a US president.

Omarova believes private bank accounts should be taken over and controlled by the Federal Reserve.

“Imagine what it would be like instead of just a public option for deposit banking, this would be actually the full transition. In other words, there would be no more private bank deposit accounts and all of the deposit accounts will be held directly at the fed,” Omarova said during recent remarks. “How is it politically feasible for the central bank to take money away from people’s accounts.”

199,qyhcx7,LucyTheML,Seeking Marxist advice on a personal moral dilemma relating to family finances and mental health.,"Hi. Sorry if this isn't the place to make a post like this. But I thought I'd come here because GZD has continually proven to have some damn smart and damn solid people here. And Marxists have some of the best logic on stuff in life, so I thought I could gleam some really solid advice from the people here.   


At the moment in my life, I (18F) live with my mother and brother in a house we moved into back in September. Recently, I starting making moves to move out of the house, as certain aspects of it were creating a very toxic environment to my mental and physical health. I told my mother and brother that I intend to move out in six months, and they flipped out and basically, this is where my moral dilemma starts:   


I have the financial ability to move out and live in an environment that is personally better for my mental health. The only reason I have to wait six months is just because that's when the place I want to move into has an open room. Doing this move would allow me to be more productive, have more control of many aspects of my life, and also improve the financial situation of the siblings that I plan to move in with, due to allowing us more funds for food-spending, etc. etc.   


However. My mother has backed herself into a very tight corner, financially. She is paying a very high mortgage for this new place she's moved us into. With my presence in her house, I pay her 600$CDN/month as rent. She also receives 500$CDN/month for child support from our estranged father. My presence in her house earns her 1,100$/month, totaling 13,200$/year. She's basically said to me that if I moved out, she couldn't keep financially afloat and would likely go bankrupt and lose the house.   


This is the core of the moral dilemma I'd like my fellow comrades to deconstruct what the best option is. I could take the 'selfish' route and move out, pursuing my happiness and better mental health, but leave my mum with a very high chance of bankruptcy. Or, I could stay and be the financial back bone of my family, allowing my mum to stay financially afloat. However, with the consequence of living in a toxic environment for the next 3-5 years, and a high chance to mentally stagnate as a person, and slip into deep throes of depression.   


I understand communism is not an ideology concerned with having to be selfless or humble. But it is an ideology concerned with love for humanity. I feel that to abandon my mother would almost be a selfish and greedy choice. But I also know, deep down that I've sacrificed a great many things for my family before, and that perhaps it is now time for me to choose myself over others.   


What do you comrades think? Mental health, or the financial stability of my mum?

If there was anyone on earth you would think would get what BLM is and has done...

BLM supporters have been wishing death on him and calling him a white supremacist. 


The Christmas parade killing of 5 and now a 6th child seems to be in response to his verdict. The alleged killer made posts that advocated killing white people.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10233565/BLM-activist-says-Waukesha-Christmas-parade-horror-left-five-dead-linked-Rittenhouse-verdict.html

Americans raised 5 million to post this man, who killed 6 white children and elderly's bail. 

https://www.insider.com/gofundme-removes-page-for-darrell-brooks-waukesha-massacre-suspect-2021-11

And what change? More unarmed white people are killed by police. White people are also the number one victims of interracial violence.

Tony Timpa and Daniel Shaver happened before George Floyd. The killings were on par or even more brutal and the cops got off.

243,qkjrjd,Prettykittybaby,A quick example of why Marxist thinking is pure GARBAGE,"Marxist thinking states: “Workers create the wealth that makes the entrepreneur wealthy, and therefore are entitled Ato their fair share of the profits,” is a crock of 💩.  
  
  The entrepreneur created the SYSTEM to make himself wealthy.  The worker has merely volunteered to be a cog in this established system for an agreed-upon compensation.

 Here is a real world example to illustrate this.  
 I had a technician (call this the “manual labour”) once complain to me that she felt underpaid: “Why do I only get paid 20% of every job value when I am doing ALL of the actual physical work?!🤔 …and why does the sales team gets paid twice as much as I do - 40% of each job - when they’re doing NONE of the actual physical repair work??”
 
 It took all of 5 seconds to explain this to her and she understood it completely:
   “Because the sales team is the ENGINE driving this entire machine. Without them, then there is NO WORK FOR YOU. And so we pay them very handsomely. As they are the ones who keep the food on ALL of our plates.”

 She sheepishly grinned as the realization set it and her discontentedness evaporated the very moment I finished explaining.  She also apologized for failing to make the same connection herself. …And happily went back to work with a new gusto!! 😄

**Pictures with measurements for size XL:** [**https://imgur.com/a/YGDSwQ9**](https://imgur.com/a/YGDSwQ9)

&#x200B;

**Quality (9/10):**

Just seen as a pair of pants for roughly 80€ retail price I'd say that these are pretty solid and well constructed.

For replica standards I'd say that these are some of the best pants I had in hand quality wise and I can directly compare them to deeds reps of the same cargo.

Hardware and overall construction marxisms pair feels superior to deeds one, which feels really flimsy and thin. Hardware is also a known issue with deeds pants in general, Marxisms again solid in that department (now I need to get sixis one which is said to be the best lol).

(Keep in mind though that deeds only costs 379 yuan and Marxisms 599 yuan, so you get what you pay for basically).

&#x200B;

**Sizing (10/10):**

Very important for guys like me with thick thighs and fortunately Marxism is pretty accurate to his sizechart which is also rather big.

I feel like the sizing varies a bit from retail in the bigger sizes for marxism but if you are someone who cannot fit into more accurate replicas from other sellers, then marxism is your savior.

**Pictures with measurements for size 52:**  [https://imgur.com/a/e7nuhk6](https://imgur.com/a/e7nuhk6)

&#x200B;

**Quality (8.5/10):**

I gotta say these are very solid on hardware and overall construction, **except** for the clasp(?) above the zipper. It feels really flimsy and I have to be careful to not rip it off sometimes but I hope I just randomly got one of the few bad ones.

&#x200B;

**Sizing (10/10):**

Once again Marxism comes in clutch for me as he is the only seller I found that has these in a size 52, most others stop at size 50. Sizing as always is a bit bigger but accurate to that size chart, so no surprises like with deeds lol.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

Unfortunately I cannot talk much on accuracy for these replicas since I'm not that knowledgeable. I did hear from others tho that Marxism isn't really known for his accuracy to retail in various ways, so if you are looking for the most accurate duplicate of retail this isn't for you (some of his replicas even have his own branding instead of retails, so be careful if you value that).

But if you are a bit on the taller or wider side and are ready to pay a bit more for an arguably better quality garment, then Marxism is definitely worth a try.

267,r079pi,wptransplant,How much of Philosophy is incompatible with Marxism (or a mistaken endeavour)?,"I’ll try to make that clearer. I was educated in the history of philosophy, broadly speaking classical Western—Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, Hume, Searle, Rawls, Nagel, Russell, Nozick, Parfit, with some detours into Hegel, Heidegger, Derrida, etc.

We never studied Marx, however, and my understanding of political philosophy came from the metaphysical-distributive mode.

I’ve recently been getting into Marx, and what is shocking to me is that I can’t seem to reconcile just what he is. Sometimes I feel like an entire world was ignored by Philosophy, and that to understand Marx means basically throwing out large swaths of the history of philosophy—that Marx basically operates in a way similar to Kant in that he shows how experience is mediated; unlike Kant, he thinks it’s mediated by the capitalist system, which creates a worldview. It’s here where I get troubled, because it implies that idealist philosophy generally—from Kant to Rawls and on—is starting from the flawed premise, perhaps akin to the Heidegger idea of being “thrown” into an already existing state of affairs.

I guess what it’s showing in a sense is not just that two economic systems are opposed—socialist and capitalist—and also not just that one favors individuals and one favors groups, but that one actually engineers the way thought is generated. To be blunt, it makes me wonder if all that philosophy I studied was actually fruit from a poison tree.

This is such a large question—it’s hard to wrap your mind around it, because it entails the very possibility of objectivity (can you abstract your subjectivity with some tool to arrive at an objective understanding), but on the one hand it seems very simplistic—how can Marx be correct when he’s not really dealing with things like moral luck, is/ought, personal identity, justified true belief—he seems almost basic; but on the other hand, when Marxism makes sense, it suggests that a lot of that philosophy is just a mistake. I haven’t felt quite this shaken since I really “got” Aristotle once or twice, or when I “understood” Pragmatism (including its contradictions).

I’m kind of at sea a bit here—I’m immersing myself in Marx and Chomsky and Bakunin and Murray Bookchin to help understand where I am exactly—but has anyone else had this sort of experience? Is this a common step? I always used to feel like Rawls was the be-all of political philosophy, and that his communitarian critics were just goodie goodies, but now I’m almost feeling like all of that work was elaborate justifications of the “thrownness,” and that Marx has made it all seem almost trivial.",2021-11-23 00:54:27,133

*** 

In Denmark there is an ongoing narrative pushed by liberals and conservatives alike, usually using terms like ""wokeism"" or ""activist academia"" in place of the somewhat tainted ""cultural Marxism,"" but where the content is the same: Universities are institutions inhabited by ""Reds"" who indoctrinate the students to feel ashamed of being Danish, publish pseudo-scientific journals to push certain policies, want to destroy Danish culture, and so on. The movement's figurehead is the liberal politician Henrik Dahl, former  who, following the recent municipal and regional election, tweeted out:

> Why do so many people vote for a post-communist party with a program that would, in all likelyhood would totally destroy Denmark?

> I think it is due to mass-education and red indoctrination. #dkpol

It can be regarded as somewhat of a culmination of anti-intellectualism being pushed by the liberal and the conservative parties and the social democrats in recent years.

290,qwb9dp,O43k_13,"Marxism vs. ""anti-work""","As you may have heard there's this forum on Reddit titled ""antiwork"" that has reached 1 jillion subs in a matter of months. Some – rather foolish – people take this as a justification for saying that they were right all along, meaning that ""anti-work"" is trending exactly because it has the right theory and practice, and everyone else who disagrees with this assessment can and should fuck off for being buzz-kills.

Well, I'm one such a ""buzz-kill"" person, which is to say a Marxist, and I would like to explain to you why this ""trend"" is at best ""one step forward but two steps back"" kind of issue.

First of all, let's look at the demographics – and I'm not even going to cite exact sources, because everyone knows that the following is in the right ballpark when I say that – 80-90% of Reddit posters are anglo-saxons (USA, UK, AUS, etc.) and like 70-80% of them are male, and like 60-70% of them are ""middle class"" (or above, not to mention, typically white).

Let me tell you how the above mentioned data is absolutely significant from a Marxist POV. These people are from *The* countries which spearheaded neoliberalism in the 70's-80's, which included offshoring their productive factories, unproductive call centers, and other ""high-markup cost"" jobs to all of the rest of the (then) third world (China, India, Africa, LatAm)… Today, these countries where these ""anti-work"" enthusiasts are coming from are basically *gutted* from the inconveniences, dirty realities, and proletarian misgivings that are associated with said spheres of work. On the other hand, these countries were more than ready to accept the lumpen-proletariat arriving in their stead, meaning – at least in this context – the long-term unemployed and unemployable, homeless, and inevitably criminal elements to take over said opened void left by actual workers. What remained was the historically unprecedented situation wherein, on the one hand, they had a 1) wide stratum of workers dealing with design, engineering, programming, marketing, etc., a 2) middle stratum that had to do the remaining domestic jobs like retailing, servicing, logistics, and so on – even if under completely unbearable circumstances, including having to hold 3 jobs at a time – and, 3) the afformentioned lumpen-proles.

Naturally, the wast majority of the subscribers to the ""anti-work"" sub coming from these deficient economies come from 1), followed by 2).

Now let's get real, and by that I mean, let's take the ""anti-worker's"" demands at face value. ""Abolish work,"" they say, right here, and ""right now!"" The first, and most burning contradiction appears here. These people, living in the imperial core, ""somehow"" spontaneously forget, that they, as workers of a country, sit upon a global chain of production, most of which happens in the third or developing world, and they demand that >their work< (as if, it was in a vacuum) should disappear. If they demands were a 100% met, what it would mean is the TOTAL ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OF THE ANGLO-SAXON WORLD, INCLUDING THE US EMPIRE ITSELF.

If their demands were to be met, put it otherwise, they would be left with an Empire *unable to enforce* said global production chain, leading to severe famine and overall product shortages, and making said domestic jobs insufficient, not to mention even further extending the lumpen-proletariat at home. As it stands today, and as it stands today especially in capitalist core countries, ""anti-work"" is an insane utopia, the proponents of which do not even begin (as if they bothered to think, lol) to measure the consequences of their demands.

Worse – and this is where it gets grim –, I've spoken in real life with several ""anti-work enthusiasts,"" and when you ask them about such critical abstractions such as ""What happens to your supposedly successful revolution, economically speaking?"" they give you these following vague answers: ""The value form will be immediately abolished!"" (Jesus Christ!); ""We will start an economy of mutual exchange!"" (example: a cheese producer will give a certain amount of cheese to the doctor to cure him of his cancer); ""Complete decentralization will happen, the state will be overthrown!""

Put these answers together, and by no means do you get ""anarchism,"" you get total fucking economic collapse and political chaos.

And finally, and what makes my heart ache more than anything, is when radical leftists from fucking third-world, EU-peripherial, or colonized countries chime in and they unironically identify with said project, completely forgetting the simple fact that they are the ""power house"" of capitalism, while those who dream about ""anti-work"" ARE ALREADY LIVING IN A MOSTLY DE-WORKERIFIED economy.

In closing: yes, for sure, Marxists do actually think that we, as a human species can and should reach a level where ""society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic."" (Marx in Gotha), but by no means do we mean that this could be achieved at a snap of a finger. YES, WE MARXISTS ARE """"""ANTI-WORK"""""" TOO, BUT FOR US THE MAIN QUESTION IS ""HOW TO GET THERE"" INSTEAD OF ASSUMING THAT WE ARE ALREADY THERE ON A GLOBAL LEVEL.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_socialism

Thanks to Marxism and derivatives the socialist narrative has largely been about the mode of production, many times neglecting social issues to focus on materialism. Socialists have fought for social rights issues for a long time—yet the mode of production, to seize control over it and completely remove private ownership is always there at the center. *I think this is disingenuous to the root of socialism which as I have said a million times is to care for the people's well being*.

Marx, Engels and so many others seem to think that classes, specifically economic classes are the root cause of most if not all strife. *That is simply not true* and simplifies something that yes, is partially deeply rooted in economic class differences, but social factors are equally if not even more important. 

I recently officially joined the Social Democrats (Swe) after going to my first ever political meeting (with SocDems). As a socialist I felt at home as they/we talked about for example school and physical activities like sports. The other guys organize and talk to various sports organizations to ask them what it is they want, such as upgrades to sporting facilities. So in one way or another it more or less almost always comes back to money, sure, but that is the very society we live in today. But my point is that the main focus was always, in this meeting, *on just improving things in life for others*. THERE you have what line of thought led to the creation of socialism hundreds of years ago; to see how unfair the world is and simply wanting to improve it due to your own empathy for others. Does this apply to other ideologies as well? Well of course it does. But that does not mean it still isn't what basically started socialism. Socialism is thus, or orginially was and as such at its core about certain ways to improve the world.

The longer people do not see socialism for the spectrum that it really is and *always* has been the longer we will stay divided amongst the various socialist communities, between socialists and non-socialists and even between non-socialists as someone might hate socialism because they think it is one very specific thing, leading to anti-sentiment rather than just preferring something else.

Now, you could say that marxist-leninism that targeted the peasantry took a different path. But in almost all cases, once the government consolidated political and economic power, it took control over the entire country - like a parasite would.

Not only that, but socialism and communism made efforts to spread across the world: USSR funded many countries in exchange for letting the people not for communism. China funded Cambodia in the late 70s.

And if you've lived there, too, you know it's very, very easy to get called a communist..... for like any reason. We just have a huge amount of people that basically use ""communist"" as another way of saying ""person I disagree with about literally anything.""

This is getting kind of out of hand. People call the Democrats communists, people called Big Bird a communist for getting vaccinated, people assume you're a communist if you go to university, people think Hollywood is run by communists, blahblahblah.

So yeah, if you're not familiar, the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory is basically just that there is an infinite amount of small signs that indicate a person is secretly a communist, and also for a very long time a cabal of communists has slowly infiltrated all of society's institutions and are on the verge of tearing down our society as it is and ushering in some new totalitarian era.

Pretty whacky, right? The whackier part is that there is an alarmingly large amount of Americans that actually believe that this is happening. And what is most shocking to me is how the conspiracy theory has already been done by the Nazis and yet people are still buying it.

Like.... I would expect ""the Nazis originally thought that up"" to be a decent enough sign for most people to stop for a second and think, ""ah, the Nazis weren't exactly trustworthy or sensible people. Maybe this is all BS,"" but I guess not.

And.... there's also just the part where there's 0 evidence of a cabal of communists taking over the country.....

Bottled up inside me and decided had to spill this out, after arguing for a long time with this dumb German Libertarian Marxist.","The inherent differences between German and Chinese culture make it so that Marx, a German, cannot possibly comprehend the special Cultural and Societal characteristics of China and the differences in human nature between German and Chinese. 

Marx believes that human nature is inherently unselfish, and that as long as everyone has basic needs for living, there will be no more crime, no more greed, no more rivalry or jealousy or hate of any kind. That is his inherent flaw and the naivety of the German mindset. That may be true in his mother country, Germany, where traditional cultural values uphold frugality and simplicity, but not in China. In China there is a saying:""一個中國人是龍，一群中國人是蟲 One Chinese is a dragon, a group of Chinese are insects."" What does this mean? Chinese are naturally more self-serving and than their German counterparts. This sounds extremely discriminatory and even horrible in a way, but it is even agreed amongst MANY CHINESE THEMSELVES that their own people are among the most self-serving and lacking in selfless persons compared to other societies in other nations. Marxism cannot work when people are self-servient, which means, it can hardly work outside of the strangely simple German people. 

STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CHINA IS #1 in the world IN TERMS OF MONEY WORSHIP. Studies also prove that Chinese are traditionally, in the long course of history, MUCH MORE EXTRAVAGANT THAN THEIR simple, rather rustic GERMAN COUNTERPARTS. In marriage, Chinese also have a custom of the groom buying a house for the bride. In Germany, newly wed couples go into run-down rented apartments and are perfectly fine with it, they won't whine like Chinese couples do. German culture is frugal and simple, so it definitely fits Marx. Chinese culture is extravagant, complex, and money-oriented, therefore trying to fix Marx in would be like trying to fit an iPhone charger into an Android. 

And when I mean Marxism, I don't mean *just* authoritarian marxist-leninism, on the contrary, Libertarian Marxism would be even worse for China!

Marxism is MOST IMPORTANTLY, in conflict with NATIONALISM. Marx advocates that the working man should have no National loyalty. A China with no National Loyalty among its working class? Chaos! 

That is why, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-state\_capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-state_capitalism) **Kuomintang** ***Dangguo*** **State Capitalism, is the answer, and has consistently proven to be the right model for China. When Taiwan deviated from this model it declined. When the CPC plagiarized and made a cheap ripoff of this model it finally worked better than it used to under Marxism. Those CPC hardliners who say that, the 1949-1978 phase of Marxism was ""necessary"" for the second phase of ripping off the KMT to work, is outright bs and a long stretch to justify the 30 years of China that was wasted on tinkering with Marxism. 黨國萬歲，三民主義萬歲！Long live Dangguo! Long live 3PP! 🇹🇼**

now that explains stuff , such as most modern science , space time , fields , electrons , are described by mathematical equations , 

so is that math just a fancier name for the stuff phicists study , instead of a saying wave they call with the equation of a wave , in the same way in wich a dog would be called canis lupus familiaris by a zoologist , 

to me however this doesn't explain the predictive power math has : for example [imaginary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number) are a part of math that got discovered around the 1500 , and they where used as a way to solve [cubic equations](https://youtu.be/cUzklzVXJwo) , and got discovered subsequently both in turbolent flow and quantum phisics , 

wich are real world stuff , as such math in a sense by playing around with numbers pepole discovered part of reality , wich is peculiar from a strictly materialist marxist pov. 

i am sure mao or another thinker already tought about this , and figured this one out , i am just asking because this idealist bump is sticking out in the way in wich i understand the world ...",2021-11-26 06:49:54,3

For example this text by Anton Pannkoek written in 1909 called The Destruction of Nature illustrates the far-left view on the enviroment very well -

>There are numerous complaints in the scientific literature about the increasing destruction of forests. But it is not only the joy that every nature-lover feels for forests that should be taken into account. There are also important material interests, indeed the vital interests of humanity. With the disappearance of abundant forests, countries known in Antiquity for their fertility, which were densely populated and famous as granaries for the great cities, have become stony deserts. Rain seldom falls there except as devastating diluvian downpours that carry away the layers of humus which the rain should fertilise. Where the mountain forests have been destroyed, torrents fed by summer rains cause enormous masses of stones and sand to roll down, which clog up Alpine valleys, clearing away forests and devastating villages whose inhabitants are innocent, ""due to the fact that personal interest and ignorance have destroyed the forest and headwaters in the high valley"".

>The authors strongly insist on personal interest and ignorance in their eloquent description of this miserable situation but they do not look into its causes. They probably think that emphasising the consequences is enough to replace ignorance by a better understanding and to undo the effects. They do not see that this is only a part of the phenomenon, one of numerous similar effects that capitalism, this mode of production which is the highest stage of profit-hunting, has on nature.

>Why is France a country poor in forests which has to import every year hundreds of millions of francs worth of wood from abroad and spend much more to repair through reforestation the disastrous consequences of the deforestation of the Alps? Under the Ancien Regime there were many state forests. But the bourgeoisie, who took the helm of the French Revolution, saw in these only an instrument for private enrichment. Speculators cleared 3 million hectares to change wood into gold. They did not think of the future, only of the immediate profit.

>For capitalism all natural resources are nothing but gold. The more quickly it exploits them, the more the flow of gold accelerates. The private economy results in each individual trying to make the most profit possible without even thinking for a single moment of the general interest, that of humanity. As a result, every wild animal having a monetary value and every wild plant giving rise to profit is immediately the object of a race to extermination. The elephants of Africa have almost disappeared, victims of systematic hunting for their ivory. It is similar for rubber trees, which are the victim of a predatory economy in which everyone only destroys them without planting new ones. In Siberia, it has been noted that furred animals are becoming rarer due to intensive hunting and that the most valuable species could soon disappear. In Canada, vast virgin forests have been reduced to cinders, not only by settlers who want to cultivate the soil, but also by ""prospectors"" looking for mineral deposits who transform mountain slopes into bare rock so as to have a better overview of the ground. In New Guinea, a massacre of birds of paradise was organised to satisfy the expensive whim of an American woman billionaire. Fashion craziness, typical of a capitalism wasting surplus value, has already led to the extermination of rare species; sea birds on the east coast of America only owe their survival to the strict intervention of the state. Such examples could be multiplied at will.

>But are not plants and animals there to be used by humans for their own purposes? Here, we completely leave aside the question of the preservation of nature as it would be without human intervention. We know that humans are the masters of the Earth and that they completely transform nature to meet their needs. To live, we are completely dependent on the forces of nature and on natural resources; we have to use and consume them. That is not the question here, only the way capitalism makes use of them.

>A rational social order will have to use the available natural resources in such a way that what is consumed is replaced at the same time, so that society does not impoverish itself and can become wealthier. A closed economy which consumes part of its seed corn impoverishes itself more and more and must inevitably fail. But that is the way capitalism acts. This is an economy which does not think of the future but lives only in the immediate present. In today's economic order, nature does not serve humanity, but capital. It is not the clothing, food or cultural needs of humanity that govern production, but capital's appetite for profit, for gold.

>Natural resources are exploited as if reserves were infinite and inexhaustible. The harmful consequences of deforestation for agriculture and the destruction of useful animals and plants expose the finite character of available reserves and the failure of this type of economy. Roosevelt recognises this failure when he wants to call an international conference to review the state of still available natural resources and to take measures to stop them being wasted.

>Of course the plan itself is humbug. The state could do much to stop the pitiless extermination of rare species. But the capitalist state is in the end a poor representative of the good of humanity. It must halt in face of the essential interests of capital.

>Capitalism is a headless economy which cannot regulate its acts by an understanding of their consequences. But its devastating character does not derive from this fact alone. Over the centuries humans have also exploited nature in a foolish way, without thinking of the future of humanity as a whole. But their power was limited. Nature was so vast and so powerful that with their feeble technical means humans could only exceptionally damage it. Capitalism, by contrast, has replaced local needs with world needs, and created modern techniques for exploiting nature. So it is now a question of enormous masses of matter being subjected to colossal means of destruction and removed by powerful means of transportation. Society under capitalism can be compared to a gigantic unintelligent body; while capitalism develops its power without limit, it is at the same time senselessly devastating more and more the environment from which it lives. Only socialism, which can give this body consciousness and reasoned action, will at the same time replace the devastation of nature by a rational economy.",2021-10-23 09:51:09,14
442,qq9tkj,AnnaE390,I feel like it’s important to clarify for Socialists that Capitalism is not like Marxism; it is not a religion or critical methodology.,"The number one complaint I hear from Marxists about capitalism is that capitalism allows for exploitation, which suggests there seems to be a collective misunderstanding among Marxists that capitalism is supposed to be an all encompassing solution for social and political problems.

It is not.

It’s just an economic system.  It governs how we interact in trad and nothing else.

Capitalism itself can exist along side or within virtually any form of social organization.  For example, North Korea has black markets, and they are “permitted” to exist to meet the demands for goods the government cannot.   In these black markets, prices are determined by supply and demand, and the only incentive for merchants to sell goods is personal profit.  However, the overarching sociopolitical  system of North Korea is collectivist, and their economic system is socialist.  In an individualist society, sociopolitical issues are governed by their own systems — like religion or courts — and capitalism would govern the economy *alone*.

Marxism and it’s offshoots like feminism, environmentalism, critical theory, etc., propose to solve every individual problem we face.  It promises heaven on Earth, and I feel socialist think capitalist view capitalism in the same way.

Again, we don’t. 

Capitalism will do nothing to save the environment or lower domestic abuse rates or get more blacks into college.  If the question is merely: “What is the fairest way to allocate scare resources,” our answer is 

Capitalism.",2021-11-09 12:21:25,0

Maybe I am misunderstanding idealism, but it seems quite..mystical? 

Is this the difference between idealism and materialism? 

Materialism: Consciousness is based on the material world. There are physical structures in the body and outside of it that interact to form thoughts. Language is learned from exposure to language. Religion is learned from exposure to it. Everything is tied to something physical. 

Idealism: Consciousness is an unknown entity, and it impacts the material world, versus the material world impacting thoughts. 

I haven’t taken a philosophy class so I apologize if this is completely inaccurate, but I’m having a hard time understanding how people can still argue for idealism, especially when Marx describes how one’s material environment influences thoughts, which is a common view in sociology and anthropology.
