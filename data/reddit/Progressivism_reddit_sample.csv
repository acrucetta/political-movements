9,r528a2,PoopMobile9000,"PSA: Any spike in violent crime is not the result of progressive politicians, you reactionary psychos.","Over the past few weeks there's been a rash of shootings near Lake Merritt, close to where I live.  I've started to see some posts popping up here with comments sections that read like a NextDoor page in the suburbs, trying to blame these crimes on local politicians being ""woke"" or some nonsense.  GTFO.

The recent spike in violent crimes has NOTHING to do with progressive, ""Defund the Police"" shit.  You know why?  First, *ALMOST NONE OF THOSE REFORMS WERE ACTUALLY ENACTED*.  Second, the spike in violent crimes is happening *EVERYWHERE* in the United States, including deep red cities and states, regardless of who's in charge or what policies they've enacted over the last couple years.

This isn't how crime works.  People don't commit crimes because they heard a slogan 15 months ago.   Cause and effect still exist.  If there is an increase of crime under the policing regime that's been in place for decades, it's the fault of the status quo establishment, not the fault of reformers suggesting reforms in the future. Or, more likely, it's the fault of some of the other shit that's been hitting the country as a whole, like the global pandemic we're still in that's wildly disrupted social structures alongside record-high gun ownership.

Also, for what it's worth, the current crime ""spike"" would put Oakland in line with where it was for most of the 2000s, after 2017-2019 gave us the lowest homicide rates in decades.",2021-11-29 12:31:01,481

1. Autonomous SmartDesk Pro. $760 before taxes (work discount). Perfect dimension for my space (53"" x 29""). Hole cut outs are in the right spot.   
The only concern I have is testimonials of subpar customer service, although every time I got to their live chat, someone usually replies within minutes. Also it's made in China so quality might be an issue, but they do have a 7 year warranty.   

2. Progressive Solo Rizer. $750 before taxes. Dimension is a little narrower than I'd like, but still good (48"" x 30""). Has collision detection. 15 year warranty. Distribution center is in Canada so I should get it quick.   
The concern I have is the hole cut out is right in the middle, where my monitor stand would be at. So with the grommet that comes with it, it's not going to sit flush on the desk with my monitor stand. 

I could just get the Progressive Solo Rizer frame for $475, but I've been having trouble finding a white desk top that has the dimension I want (48-53"" length, 30"" width)

Does anybody have any thoughts, or experiences with either of these desks? Any suggestions on finding a desktop if I want to just get the Progressive frame? 

Thanks in advance!",2021-10-21 01:21:28,3
18,qlwuop,StopHavingAnOpinion,Is not being Trump enough? Glenn Youngkin wins Virginia's governor race. Several subreddits discuss whether or not they are being moderate or progressive enough,"**Context**: Glenn Youngkin, a Republican senator, is predicted to win the Virginia gubernatorial race. However, his tactics have been haywire. He both supports Trump to gain his supporters, but wants to keep him at a distance to keep anti-Trump republicans from supporting him. He criticised his Democrat opposition for his educational stance, arguing that education absolutely did need the input of parents, whether or not this is a good thing. The attitude towards Democrats may have been worsened by the statement that parents should have no role in it, after many families spent a year homeschooling their children. The article also argues that the Democrat Party is being stumped by Manchin and Sinema in government, and that Republican enthusiasm is generally higher than Democrat enthusiasm. Is hope over for the 2022 mid-terms? Has the target of Trump been an ineffective support generator? Did CRT and 'wokeness' cost the election? Who needs purged, the Moderates or the Progressives? Will political apathy kill us all? Are people voting against their own interests? Did the Democrat ad campaign cost them?

**EDIT:  BONUS TOPICS**

There have been several elections and moderate vs progressive legislative decisions in the last few days. Moreover, across the country, other mayor/governor elections have seen progressive aspects go into decline. For example, a more moderate candidate won in Seattle, in Minnepolis, a proposal to replace the CPD charter fails. (Basically, 'Defund the Police' has been delayed)

Recently, an election in Seattle saw a largely moderate, less progressive candidate win. Many blame the state of homelessness and the lax approach to crime such as theft as being defining factors. Supposedly, 'wokesters' and 'far leftists' have been taking over car parks, putting homeless people out of them and offered inadequete solutions to the homelessness crisis. In saying that, I am not an expert, it's better if you check all the details yourself.

[Are all of us that pushed for the moderate ticket still trolls now? We fucking won. These margins are better than I could have imagined. I am so excited to see Seattle start to do an 180. It’s a long road ahead but with our new moderate leadership, we’re going to get there. I’ll eat my words if progressives can make up 20 points, but I just don’t see it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/qlljqv/gutman_seattle_results_mayor_harrell_6463/hj3sytj/)

[Regardless of what does or does not change as a result of these elections, it looks like a pretty big indication that a majority of the voters are fed up with the homelessness problem and feel like the current solutions are not cutting it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/qlljqv/gutman_seattle_results_mayor_harrell_6463/hj3xxt0/)

[If you look at some of the other results today across the nation, like Eric Adams winning in NYC, question 2 failing in Minneapolis (charter that would allow the police department to be shrank), it was a horrible night for defunding the police and abolishing prisons. Progressives need to abandon these policies and they can come back to winning elections. Question 2 in Minneapolis failed massively with black working class residents. They didn’t want it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/qlljqv/gutman_seattle_results_mayor_harrell_6463/hj3tr0a/)

In Minnepolis, a CPD charter fails to pass, which damaged the 'Defund the Police' movement.

Men are stronger and faster than women. They have the capacity to be stronger and faster than women. That’s why there’s separate categories for men and women in sport. A person who goes through male puberty and has male genes is going to have major advantages over women in sport and could inflict serious injury in team sports. I’m not going to cite studies or statistics because it’s unnecessary. It’s fucking obvious. 

 the media is engaging in some serious fucking gaslighting.

I’m curious to see what lawsuits will come forward after females are seriously injured after being forced to play against / with transgender women 

It’s not ok.

91,qrnjye,aDuckedUpGoose,"I hope you don't mind me ranting, because after my recent car buying experience, I'm fucking pissed. Mainly at progressive, but really with just about everything.","I used to drive a nissan 370z, that was until she was taken from me. Sudden slowdown happened on the interstate and the guy behind me thought my brakes were good enough for the both of us. Though she saved my life, my z was stolen from me, and the start of my rage. 

Then comes insurance. The other party's insurance, the guy who slammed into me, still hasn't accepted fault, so I am still out 1000 dollars for the deductible. How the fuck are they even able to deny fault when there are multiple witnesses saying traffic and my car came to a complete stop and he slammed into me? Because fuck insurance, that's why.

Then comes the rental...a Ford edge...Absolutely the worst vehicle I've ever laid cheeks on. That's including my cousin's broken fire chicken with a beautiful 90s GM interior and my grandpa's riding lawn mower that he claims is 50 years old. without getting too much into it, I basically hated everything about the car. To make it worse, the infotainment was broken. It just kept selecting things and going through menus on it's own. It would disconnect phones from bluetooth, go to AM radio, and set various preset stations. All on it's own. 

Then comes the car search. I live in the boulder CO area, and most of the cars I found were near Denver. Lemme tell you, I found all the shady dealers. I've been bait and switches thrice. The worst was at offroad truck and auto in Fort Lupton. I found a Mazda 3 for sale that had been listed over 100 days, it's still listed by the way. I set an appointment to look at the car, and what do you know, they just happened to sell it that day and not let me know. But they have a nissan armada I could've looked at...because that's similar...Some used car dealer in Denver, Prince Auto, tried to sell me a broken car then lied about fixing the problem. Stupid sluts. 

Then comes yesterday and what really burns my biscuits. Apparently, this is specific to the state of CO, but insurance canceled my rental they were paying for because they totalled my car. No one told me, but once they total a car, they cancel the rental in 3 days. I was supposed to have 30, but I guess they decided I should go fuck myself instead. This was cancelled on November 1st. The only reason I found out is enterprise was kind enough to call me and let me know I owed them for ten days and counting.

Naturally, I fucking hate the government mandated scam that is auto insurance, so I look into just how bad it is to drive in the state of CO without insurance. Turns out, really fucking stupidly bad. Let's pretend the other insurance party wasn't a bunch of ass hairs and accepted fault for their driver hitting me. If I was uninsured, the state of CO does not require the at fault party to pay a dime. If I didn't have insurance, even if I'm not at fault for an accident, I won't get any money unless the person who hits me feels bad. 

So yesterday, without a car, mad at the world and just about anything; I find a 2014 hyundai elantra with 3 pedals. She's in good shape, and the dealer even seem like decent people. Shockingly, the listed price was the actual price of the vehicle! No fees, just taxes. And now, after all this shit, I'm left with this empty feeling of rage. Been fucked around with so much but finally ended up in a decent car that I may actually grow to like. 

If you actually read all that, you're a wild person. It feels kinda good to angrily slap this rant on my keyboard. Maybe if you've been fucked over by insurance share your story. I've got a few more like when I first realized that insurance is a total scam and started losing all faith in american institutions and humanity at large. 

Hopefully you never lose a car. And hopefully you will only quietly hate insurance, not loudly like I currently do.

oh well maybe they can grind crafting skill? No, because you nerfed that too, so painful grind is even more painful now and takes another tens of hours just for one skill for no reason.

Doing bunch of undocumented changes so casuals can't call you out? Do you really think, that even they won't notice how you are butchering, what could have been a great game?

You PR bs the 'fancy' changes, when actually you have done so many hidden changes, that will cause players to stop playing because nothing is fun anymore.

Also I get it that gear perk bugs happen, like Weavers knot, but changing it instead of keeping it as a 'legacy' item, which still people can get anyways?

112,qs3ooh,bramblefuzz,I’m really tired of hearing about how progressive your church is,"As a former Christian, I really struggle to grasp the logic behind progressive ideologies being adopted within a conservative belief system. Now on the outside, I find great relief in reconciling  my own progressive political and social world views and accepting them as the lens from which I see the world. When I was a Christian, this was a point of great conflict internally for me. Christian’s believe that scripture is the inerrant word of God and scripture is very clear on issues such as homosexuality, premarital sex, women’s authority (or lack there of), etc etc.

I can certainly understand the turmoil of being a believer and trying to reconcile your world views- but to start rewriting the “rules” to suit your own beliefs is a slippery slope. Either scripture is inerrant or it isn’t- if it is so broadly open to interpretation that you can dismiss some of the clearest instructions it provides, isn’t it just another short stop on the line to making up an entirely new religion? Moreover, if you’re opening the door to the idea that scripture is somewhat flawed, how are you also not permitting that scripture could be entirely flawed? 

Splitting hairs I say. So the next time you meet a “conservative” or “orthodox” practitioner of any belief-do give them credit for being truthful to their own faith and drinking their cool-aid full strength. It’s more honest.",2021-11-11 22:49:54,456

They argue about everything, but on this they come together and the rest of us suffer. Progressives don't want new development in their urban neighborhood for environmental reasons or because they don't like what they call ""gentrification"" and they want to ""preserve the character of the neighborhood"". Conservatives don't want new development in their suburban neighborhoods, they don't want low income housing or apartments near them. So no one wants new development near them and they use the power of government to prevent it, that leads to an artificial shortage of housing, which leads to higher housing prices and the homelessness crisis we are experiencing today.

122,qzgrmx,Abject_Royal_5651,"As an exmuslim, I want to ask some questions to both progressive muslims, and the exmuslims who participate in this sub","My questions for progressive muslims:
-

Progressive Muslims always claim that you are not trying to change Islam, rather to return to the real Islam, aka pre 18th century slam, because apparently Islam was corrupted & became extremely conservative somewhere in 18th century. But how is that true? Like,

1. Which scholar in the last 1400 years said that hijab isn’t mandatory? The only few scholars who say that women can expose their hair are modern day scholars like Khaled Abou El Fadl, Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, Shabir Ally, Adnan Ibrahim. But can you show any single scholar from the past who said that hijab isn’t mandatory for muslim women? As far as I know, even Javed Ahmad Ghamidi's teachers believed that hijab is mandatory, I saw an interview of Ghamidi where he mentioned this, & said that he disagrees with his teachers on the issue of hijab as well as so many other things (tbh, he has ikhtilaf with his teachers on almost everything). So, can you name even at least one sahaba, tabiien or classical Islamic scholar, or even a scholar from before 20th century who claimed that hijab isn't mandatory for women? Just one? If not, then how is claiming ""hijab is not mandatory for muslim women"" not an effort to change Islam?

2. Which scholar in the past declared that stoning is not a punishment for adultery according to Islamic sharia? The only scholars I find are Javed Ghamidi, Shabir Ally, Adnan Ibrahim & some Al Azhar scholars from 1960s. But other than these modern day scholars, can you actually show me a classical scholar who said that adulterers should not be stoned to death? Any sahaba, tabiien, classical scholars like Abu Hanifa or Imam Malik, middle age scholars or at least scholars from pre 20th century? Or at least one scholar who said something like ""sharia punishments can change with day & age""? Just one? If not, then how is claiming something like "" stoning is not a part of islam"" not an effort to change Islam?

3. Which scholar in the last 1400 years say that apostasy is not punishable by death? Not these modern day post 20th century scholars, but the sahabas, tabieen or classical scholars, medieval scholars or pre 20th century scholars? Anyone? If no, then how is it not an effort to change Islam when you claim that apostasy has no death penalty in Islam?

4. Which scholar in the past said that women can lead men in prayer? Except for modern day scholars like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, Khaled Abou El Fadl, Adnan Ibrahim or Shabir Ally, which sahaba, tabieen, classical, middle age or pre 20th century scholar said this? If no one said this, then how is claiming that ""women can lead men in prayer"" not an effort to change Islam?

I appreciate you guys for not having the same horrible beliefs as other Muslims, but how can you guys call your belief ""Islam""? Because what you believe is just so different from what's written in the Quran hadith, scholarly consensus & what other muslims believe.

My questions for the exmuslims who support ""Progressive Islam"":
-

I can see a number of exmuslims frequently on this sub who support progressive Islam (or liberal Islam, secular Islam, or whatever you call it). My questions for you guys:

1. Why do you support Progressive Islam/Liberal/Modernist Reformist Islam movement? Shouldn’t it have been the opposite, shouldn’t you be more strictly against this progressive Islam than mainstream Islam? Because if progressive Islam didn’t exist, then there would have been more exmuslims, those Muslims who would become frustrated with Islamic laws just leave Islam. But with progressive Islam on board, many frustrated Muslims will just start criticizing those Islamic laws, hadiths & scholars, but they will not leave Islam in the end, so ultimately the number of exmuslims wouldn’t rise. Isn't this a loss for exmuslims? So why do you support progressive Islam? [Also, what surprised me the most is that except Apostate Prophet & Armin Navabi, almost all of the prominent exmuslims (like Abdullah Sameer, Veedu Vidz, Hassan Radwan, Abdullah Gondal, Harris Sultan etc) support progressive Islam. Like why? Because progressive Islam will ultimately prevent Muslims from leaving Islam, which will be a failure for exmuslims. Still, why do even exmuslim activists support progressive Islam?]

136,qxvret,CuckBartowski,We've heard from the neoliberals. We've heard from the conservatives. Now let me offer you a take on the Rittenhouse verdict from a progressive....,"Having seen the evidence, it's blatantly obvious that Rittenhouse, though clearly a nut in his own right, was simply defending himself.  Granted, he probably wouldn't have been attacked if he hadn't been carrying that stupid assault weapon around in the first place, but he was within his legal rights so self-defense does apply here.

It's also worth noting that, just prior to the shooting, Rittenhouse was being chased by an angry mob who were throwing rocks at him.  One person reportedly tried to bludgeon him with a large skateboard.

Here's an excerpt from Wikipedia:

> In the hours leading up to the shooting, Rittenhouse appeared in multiple videos taken by protesters and bystanders and was interviewed twice: first by a livestreamer at the car dealership where he and a number of other armed men had stationed themselves, second by McGinniss. Rittenhouse was seen talking with police officers, and offering medical aid to those who were injured.

> At 11:48 pm, Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum. Part of the first confrontation between Rittenhouse and Rosenbaum was witnessed by McGinniss to whom it seemed that **Rosenbaum and other protesters were moving toward Rittenhouse, who was trying to evade them; Rosenbaum tried to engage Rittenhouse who avoided this by sidestepping and running away.** Rittenhouse testified at trial that Rosenbaum had threatened to kill him. FBI infrared footage taken from an overhead airplane captured the shooting of Rosenbaum and the events immediately preceding it.

> The remainder of Rosenbaum's confrontation, and the following incidents with Huber and Grosskreutz, were recorded in cellphone footage from multiple angles, including the moments of the shooting. Video footage showed Rittenhouse being pursued across a parking lot by Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum threw a plastic bag containing socks, underwear, and deodorant at Rittenhouse.  **A bystander named Joshua Ziminski fired a shot into the air, and then Rittenhouse stopped running and turned towards the sound of the shot. Rittenhouse testified at trial that prior to being chased by Rosenbaum, he heard another man tell Rosenbaum to ""get him and kill him,"" but also knew that Rosenbaum was unarmed.  Rittenhouse testified that he aimed his gun at Rosenbaum to deter him from pursuing him further.**

...

> **Rittenhouse then ran down the street towards police vehicles. After hearing gunshots about a block away, a video journalist from The Washington Post observed Rittenhouse run past with his rifle followed by a few protesters in pursuit. According to the criminal complaint, at that point, protesters were heard on two different videos yelling ""Beat him up!,"" ""Hey he shot him!,"" and ""Get him! Get that dude!"".** One individual struck Rittenhouse from behind, knocking off his cap, shortly after which Rittenhouse tripped and fell to the ground. Others shouted ""What'd he do?,"" ""Just shot someone!,"" and ""Get his ass!"". One of the men in pursuit jump kicked Rittenhouse while he was still on the ground. Rittenhouse fired twice but missed the man.

> Next, according to court records and video footage, another protester, Anthony Huber, made contact with Rittenhouse's left shoulder with a skateboard as the pair struggled for control of the gun. As Huber was pulling on the rifle, Rittenhouse fired once, hitting Huber in the chest, perforating his heart and right lung, causing his rapid death.

> Gaige Grosskreutz testified that shortly before midnight he had heard gunshots to the south and observed Rittenhouse running in his direction on Sheridan Road. While filming the protest as a legal observer for the American Civil Liberties Union on a Facebook livestream, Grosskreutz said he ran alongside Rittenhouse and asked ""Hey, what are you doing?"" and ""You shoot somebody?""

> Grosskreutz testified he believed Rittenhouse was an active shooter. Grosskreutz had an expired concealed carry permit for a handgun and was carrying a Glock pistol. He approached Rittenhouse, who was on the ground, but stopped and put his hands up after Huber was shot. Grosskreutz then pointed his handgun and advanced on Rittenhouse, who shot Grosskreutz in the arm, severing most of his right biceps muscle.

> At least 16 gunshots from other sources were heard on video during the time that Rittenhouse was on the ground.

Based on this, frankly, it looks like the people who were shot in this case were the vigilantes here, not Rittenhouse.  **The people who were shot clearly instigated the confrontation and it's also clear that Rittenhouse made every attempt to flee without violence.**  It was only when someone else fired a gunshot that he stopped running and turned to defend himself.  **So he didn't even fire the first shot ffs!**

**If anything, this case exemplifies the need for better gun control policies, including reinstatement of the assault weapons ban.**  In this situation, you had people who *aren't* trained police officers responding to gunshots without knowing who's doing what.  They made what seemed to be a logical assumption at the time (given their lack of law enforcement training) and moved to assault him.

This would never have happened if those weapons hadn't been on the street in the first place, especially Rittenhouse's assault rifle.  It also shows that adding more guns makes people less safe in active shooter situations, not more.

But are the Democrats making that argument?  No.  Instead, they're trying to politicize the verdict and cite it as evidence of racial inequality in our justice system.  

I have a real problem with this.  Why?  Because racial inequality in our justice system is a very real problem and there are tons of examples of white people (police and otherwise) getting off for crimes that black people probably wouldn't.  **When you start citing cases like this, you undermine ALL of our credibility when we try to draw attention to cases where this actually is happening.**

In this case, it's obvious the verdict had nothing to do with race (especially considering that the people he shot were white ffs).  The jurors simply evaluated the evidence and came to the only reasonable verdict.  His skin color is simply not relevant here IMO.

What also bothers me is how some *attorneys* are going on TV to complain about the judge disallowing use of the word ""victim"".  This is standard practice in cases where the defendant is claiming self-defense and it's intended to avoid prejudicing the jury (it's also why we refer to the accused as ""defendant"" and not ""criminal"" or ""murderer"").  That said, I do find it odd that the judge didn't also bar use of the word ""looters"", as that, too, is prejudicial IMO.  That's what the media and its pundits should be criticizing.

Rittenhouse is clearly a right-wing gun nut.  But is he a murderer?  The evidence says no.  George Zimmerman is a racist fucking murderer.  Rittenhouse is just an idiot.  Not a murderer.  Not a hero.

The jury made the correct decision under the law.  This isn't even a close case, here.  But that's not stopping politicians from fundraising off of it.  You should see the emails already flooding my inbox....",2021-11-19 20:34:40,49

I'm Latina and lesbian and couldn't remain Catholic due to my sexuality so I've been exploring other churches lately. I would prefer a more energetic and charismatic worship experienc but also want a church that accepts me and unfortunately those two together may not be possible.

But I've found despite often talking about racial justice progressive churches I've been to are very very white. This doesn't really bother me too much, I've dated white girls plenty of times and I'm actually pretty white myself in appearance, actually I am legally ""white"", I even put down myself as white as well as of Hispanic/Latino descent on the last census. But my childhood Catholic churches were much more racially diverse as are a lot of the evangelical and neo-charismatic churches I've been to.

Dunno if this comes across as an issue to many. Like I said I'm fine attending such a church if it meets my spiritual needs and accepts me, but I can see a case it hampers their claims to be for racial justice. So yeah got me thinking, why exactly is this the case anyway?",2021-11-29 08:26:39,88

Here's mine:

**Suh Rin-I** (*Lovestruck in the City*)    

She is an activist (we see her protesting against the demolition of a public park) and an environmentalist (she does bazaars for a cause, selling her old clothes and donating the profit to save the environment). She is also an advocate of thrifting and recyling/upcycling which is sort of anticapitalism/anti-consumerism as well.

Probably unrelated but I also find her refusal to take a ""normal job"" endearing. She loves doing part time jobs and she'd have it no other way. She gives no fuc*s to what other people think of her.

And of course, there's kdrama's take on feminism which is mostly about breaking gender stereotypes but still is very much appreciated:

FL who's more intellectual or more financially independent than ML (more common in noona romance)
* Search:WWW
* Run On (second couple)
* The Beauty Inside (second couple)

FL who is stronger or equal in strength to ML 
* Mr Sunshine
* Weightlifting Fairy
* Stong Woman Do Bong So

FL who is assertive or a leader
* It's Okay Not to be Okay
* Hotel Del Luna
* Queen Seondeok

Other Kdramas that I think is quite feminist in its themes and/or feature strong independent women:

* Because This Is My First Life
* Be Melodramatic
* Age of Youth
* When the Camelia Blooms

I cannot possibly fathom a world in which Warren and Bernie haggle for a 5% billionaire wealth tax to be put into a bill and congress ends up giving them a 2% billionaire wealth tax as a compromise - they'd be laughed out of the room entirely.

177,quj2ad,unculturedmorm,"""Progressive"" mormons are worse for the world than orthodox mormons","I was reading [this article](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/11/why-white-racists-can-vote-for-black-republicans.html) about how voters are who overtly racist and vote for conservatives (republicans) are more likely to support GOP candidates of color (Ben Carson was a big second favorite of Trump supporters in 2016, for example). [This is another great article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-racist-white-voters-often-favor-black-republicans/) that explains how this happens.

This all made me think about the ""progressive"" and ""woke"" mormons in my social circles. Lately I feel I have seen an increasing number of young-adult mormons post historically accurate images of what Jesus would have looked like (with a olive-skinned, middle-eastern complexion), images of pride flags or other rainbow images that claim the are an ""ally"" to LGBTQ people, or anti-racist commentary on structural racism. They have no idea how dumb it looks for them to make these statements inter-mixed with statements like ""the family proclamation is a revelation for our day!"" or ""so glad that we have prophets who stand up for truth in a world full of confusion"".

But invariably when I talk with these same ""woke"" mormons about the ways that the church is literally opposed to progress in all of these areas (sexism, racism, gender equality, etc), their reactions range between confused to aghast. They point to members of color who have resolved their own concerns with ""past"" racist doctrines, or that one gay guy in their ward who is happy being celibate. And I can't tell you how many TBM friends I have who say that the doctrines of polygamy or male-only priesthood authority is okay because their moms or wives have found a way to be cool with it.

This is all to say that **mormons have this funny idea that pointing to the single exception to the rule somehow exonerates the lds church from any responsibility for the** **policies, doctrines, and teachings** **that were and are racist, sexist, or heterosexist** **by definition**\*\*.\*\*

To be clear, this isn't just a mormon thing: we all do this in some way. But we would all be better off if we recognized that **finding a way to be okay with or find a legitimate reason for discrimination, inequity, or injustice doesn't make it okay**.

For me, this is probably the biggest reason why the lds church is on balance a harmful institution and is not a force for good in the  world.

EDIT: Copying in a comment I wrote because I realize I didn't fully defend why ""progressive"" mormons are worse than orthodox members:

""Progressive Mormons create a platform for the church to say ""hey, we are concerned with those hot social justice issues as well!"" 

[A good example of this phenomenon is the recent article in the Washington Post ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/09/27/rise-liberal-latter-day-saints/) about the ""rise of the liberal mormons"". The lds church knows that it needs to give some amount of lip service to more progressively minded people -- if not, they would sink faster into the background than they already are. Lies that the lds church is concerned with racism, or even that it *isn't racist*, give just enough for many heavy-shelf members to hold on. Without it, they would leave and the church would fail faster. That's my take on why ""progressive mormons"" are worse than the orthodox.""",2021-11-15 09:34:38,180

188,qvnkcv,Manoj_Malhotra,Thoughts on Yougov's recent study suggesting the most electable Congressional campaigns for progressives.,">Specifically, our work asks three basic questions:  
>  
>How can progressives win in working-class America?  
>  
>How can progressives more effectively engage low-propensity  working-class voters across lines of race and geography, especially  outside large cities?  
>  
>What are the electoral advantages and disadvantages of various kinds  of progressive platforms and messaging? Can different progressive  messages work in different areas?  
>  
>Executive Summary  
>  
>Our experimental study, the first of its kind, offers a  new and powerful perspective on working-class political views. In  collaboration with the public opinion firm YouGov, we designed a survey  to test how working-class voters respond to head-to-head electoral  matchups. By asking voters to choose directly between thousands of  hypothetical candidates — rather than isolated policies or slogans — we  can develop a richer, more realistic portrait of voter attitudes than  conventional polls can provide. And by presenting this survey to a  representative group of two thousand working-class voters in five key  swing states — a much larger sample of this demographic than appears in  most polls — we are able to focus on these voters in much greater depth.  
>  
>The key takeaways of our survey, listed briefly below and discussed  in greater detail in the full report, can inform future progressive  campaigns.  
>  
>*Some of Our Takeaways*  
>  
>**Working-class voters prefer progressive candidates who focus  primarily on bread-and-butter economic issues, and who frame those  issues in universal terms.** **This is especially true outside deep-blue parts of the country.** Candidates  who prioritized bread-and-butter issues (jobs, health care, the  economy), and presented them in plainspoken, universalist rhetoric,  performed significantly better than those who had other priorities or  used other language. This general pattern was even more dramatic in  rural and small-town areas, where Democrats have struggled in recent  years.  
>  
>**Populist, class-based progressive campaign messaging appeals  to working-class voters at least as well as mainstream Democratic  messaging.** Candidates who named elites as a major cause of  America’s problems, invoked anger at the status quo, and celebrated the  working class were well received among working-class voters **—** even when tested against more moderate strains of Democratic rhetoric.  
>  
>**Progressives do not need to surrender questions of social  justice to win working-class voters, but certain identity-focused  rhetoric is a liability.** Potentially Democratic working-class  voters did not shy away from progressive candidates or candidates who  strongly opposed racism. But candidates who framed that opposition in  highly specialized, identity-focused language fared significantly worse  than candidates who embraced either populist or mainstream language.  
>  
>**Working-class voters prefer working-class candidates.** A  candidate’s race or gender is not a liability among potentially  Democratic working-class voters. However, a candidate’s upper-class  background is a major liability. Class background matters.  
>  
>**Working-class nonvoters are not automatic progressives.** We  find little evidence that low-propensity voters fail to vote because  they don’t see sufficiently progressive views reflected in the political  platforms of mainstream candidates.  
>  
>**Blue-collar workers are especially sensitive to candidate  messaging — and respond even more acutely to the differences between  populist and “woke” language.** Primarily manual blue-collar  workers, in comparison with primarily white-collar workers, were even  more drawn to candidates who stressed bread-and-butter issues, and who  avoided activist rhetoric.

I find these posts calling for libertarian purity (frankly) retarded, and counterintuitive to promoting a libertarian framework.**

Look, I'm not going to pretend to be some *died-in-the-wool Libertarian with a capital-L*, but I believe in freedom & individualism as core political values, and as an American, I support capitalism and freedom of expression. I also know there are plenty of progressives and conservatives who feel the same way (albeit in different ways and to different degrees). 

However, I don't blame them for being genuinely confused by some of the policies and ideas the LP and Libertarians broadly have put forward (abolishing public education, isolationism, abolishing all energy subsidies yet paying for expensive nuclear power (somehow?), etc). 

Sure, progressives and conservatives on this sub may be more friendly to using government to solve problems, but that doesn't mean we should dismiss them or their arguments. Unless we become a literal ancap party, we need the government to do *something*, ideally in a limited capacity.

I can reassure at least some of you with the knowledge that most LP voters and supporters (like myself) aren't nearly this radical, and indeed many libertarians are practically-speaking centrists with libertarian values. That's not how the LP party establishment or the vocal ancaps operate, however, and they are the most vocal on this sub.

So to any fellow classical liberals or libertarians, who want to elect more libertarian statesmen and implement some libertarian policies, I encourage you to engage in self-criticism. One of the great feats of any human being is to know enough about a subject to *know* you are right, and that includes things like politics and economics.

**As for the progressive and conservative people on this sub, thank you for giving this community more diversity of thought. It goes a long way to helping us understand our philosophy and how to genuinely improve our country together, and I for one am happy to receive your help along the way.**",2021-11-03 23:06:00,186

211,pxc968,labelleprovinceguy,'The Rich Have All The Money': How Young Progressives Think,"So this is anecdotal so feel free to take out your 'this is not scientific' whips out but I don't have the resources of Morning Consult at my disposal unfortunately. I have talked to a lot of young progressives, though, and if your experiences contradict mine I'd be curious to hear it but I doubt they will. In short, when I talk to young progressives about all the shit they want to do, I go 'You know this will require massive tax hikes on the middle class and those are hugely unpopular' and many say 'The middle class doesn't have much left to take. It's the rich who have all the money.'

This is of course nonsense. The robust welfare states you see in places like Denmark and Sweden work because they have much, much higher taxes on the middle class than we do in the US. There's just not that many rich people to tax. They understand that. They would tell you the trade off in security and welfare is well worth it.

But progressives, and especially young AOC enthusiast progressives, aren't making that argument. They really believe rich people pay very little (not true, though there are egregious exceptions) and if we made pay a whole lot more we could have all these nice thing... it's a fundamental denial of reality.

In 2020, I volunteered for Joe Biden and met a very nice pro-Sanders guy. We argued a lot but became close friends and he recently came here to visit me in Montreal where I currently live and work. We went out to get some food and he looks at his bill and he's like 'Damn that's expensive Mexican' and I said '15 percent sales tax"" and he's like 'Da fuq 15 percent.' I then told him you pay 37 percent income tax on every dollar you make over 49,000 and he was stunned.

I joined the Army as an officer right out of college as my first full-time job.  Did my 4 years and got out.  I look back on my time and am disappointed that more employers didn't take care of their folks at least as good as the military.   A couple of reasons why:

1.  Everybody got 30 days leave (vacation) per year that you started accruing as soon as you joined.  You could bank a maximum of 60 days (2 years worth) before you would lose leave.  But, here's the kicker, if you lost leave, it was a reportable event to the first general officer in your chain of command.  It was looked at as neither you nor your chain of command can properly manager your workload.  Not taking leave was not seen as some badge of honor like it is in some companies. 
2. Everyone got full medical, dental, and vision benefits with no deductible.
3. Everyone had housing and food.
4. Education was available for everyone's children.

Now, were there negatives, yes (quit a few, but that's another discussion), but this strikes me as the baseline floor that everyone should have.",2021-11-05 10:27:26,82

224,qye4xv,SacredScarecrow,Lotus-WoW - 5.4.8 Progressive MoP | Final Open Beta,"Greetings, friends!

Lotus-WoW Staff would like to invite you to participate in our last open beta on December 3rd 2021. Since our last appearance here we have finished scripting Townlong Steppes and we're closing in on finishing Dread Wastes (\~85%). These include NPC texts, movement, phasing, quest chains & storylines (Completable achievements), quest scripting, gossips and emotes.

Alongside this, we've updated numerous core features that will allow us for a much faster and precise development. For example the MoveSpline system allows us to more quickly manage proper waypoint movement for NPCs. Another big fix to gameplay is Spell Queue for custom lag tolerance option working as intended.

Additionally, there have been updates to the dynamic respawn system that will be fully implemented on launch.

Vale of Eternal Blossoms has been restored to its initial patch 5.0 form! (Picture below) However, it will still not be available for the beta. You can use any 5.4.8 client for the beta.

Alongside the changes to the game-server, our website is being worked on. We'll be providing the players with an entirely reworked CMS with features such as a fully working armory (almost done), different PvE & PvP ladders. The Lotus launcher and our client (mandatory, other 5.4.8 clients will not work on Lotus upon launch) will be available several weeks before the server release which we expect to be late December/early January.

What is the purpose of the beta?

Testing endgame group content such as dungeons/raids/challenge modes. Players will be able to create level 1 characters and then decide for themselves if they wish to test the old content, boost the characters to lvl 85 to test Pandaria leveling content or boost to lvl 90 to participate in the endgame content. All of this will be provided via NPCs. All gems/enchants/profession NPCs will also be provided.

We are looking forward to build a stable and friendly community, together with YOU.

The Lotus-WoW team has lot of ideas for our bright future together.

232,qcxj52,Solitarius_Unenlagia,"Thoughts on why so many ""progressive"" leftist internet/media personalities are unwilling to criticize China and North Korea?"," 

Alright. So, I listen to Secular Talk, the Humanist Report, and the Rational National.

I once subscribed to Second Thought on youtube because he has some genuinely good criticisms of American capitalism. There are other left-leaning channels I subscribe to on that platform, as well.

But one common denominator they all share seems to be a desire to never say anything explicitly condemning of China and/or North Korea;

Despite China's rise dominating the political landscape across the world, I have never heard HR or RN ever discuss the issues surrounding them despite their evident demsoc tendencies, and the few times Kyle Kulinski (who, from what I gather, is probably a demsoc) has mentioned them or North Korea, he has only talked about them fleetingly, followed by immediately switching to ""but the US is manufacturing consent for war with these nations""-types of arguments and descending down the rabbit hole of pacifism.

Second Thought never mentioned China until very recently, when he took off his mask and went so far in terms of US whataboutism that he basically did everything short of claiming that the US engineered COVID and launched a ""false flag operation"" against China in order to blame it on them (go to youtube and search ""second thought lab leak""). At least, that's what all the tankies and wumao in the comment section of this video seem to think (this video is why I unsubscribed from him, btw).

Before I was banned from this sub for calling the CCP a bunch of state capitalists (and thus before I knew the sub was full of tankies), the tankie chuds in r/  socialism thought the video was ""fair and balanced"" when I asked them for their opinions on it. So that should tell you that tankies evidently got Second Thought's message.

I have only ever seen one breadtuber/leftist internet/media personality openly and readily condem the CCP from what he claims is a leftist perspective (for clarification: this CCP-condemner's name starts with a V and ends with an h), and this sub has a rule explicitly banning the mention of him (that being said, let that be the last time anyone doing anything related to this post discusses him; *please* don't mention him in the replies, especially by name. I don't want this post to be deleted).

My overall question regarding all of this is:

Why do so many prominent leftist/breadtube personalities seem to either be tankies or have soft spots for China and North Korea? Or at the very least, why don't they want the influence of these imperialist and totalitarian dictatorships countered, and why are they so unwilling to actually condemn the regimes?

Also, can I just say: the ""no links"" rule that the mods of this sub enforce for no reason is fucking stupid.",2021-10-21 12:58:45,381

>To me Progressivism has several corollaries:

•	It means freedom of speech and freedom to think, even if those views threaten the powerful

•	It means society is judged by how it treats the poorest amongst us, not by how it rewards the rich

•	Structures—political, economic, social—are the real root of problems, and solutions require careful, incremental fixing of structures, not shaming or blaming of individuals. 

•	Tolerance & compassion were core tenets amongst progressives I admired.

>COVID19 killed progressivism.  People who identify on the political left, are increasingly frenzied and disinhibited. Their policies contradict all of the principles of progressivism. Let me highlight a few e.g..

>**1.     Censoring misinformation.** Many progressives have embraced the idea that social media must censor ‘misinformation.’  But none of them are capable of defining the line between honest debate and misinformation. Few appreciate the potential for an authoritarian to abuse this power.  [see video](https://youtu.be/IV5c8mva9-s)

>And consider the case of lab leak—Facebook suppressed discussion of it for 4 months—only to rescind after it was clear we needed to have that discussion. You cannot censor science in a crisis. It is too volatile, too live, and too unsettled.

>**2.     We forgot the poor!** The policies that were pushed by the left were policies that shielded principally the zoom class of worker—the upper middle class, highly educated laborer.  Among these: school closures.  What will soon be seen as the greatest policy blunder of the pandemic; One that will scar the lives of hundreds of thousands of kids.  This policy was pushed by left of center cities, and cities with strong teachers’ unions.  Progressives forgot about the poorest amongst us, while red states remembered.

>**3.     Blamed people not structures**—the rhetoric online was a constant stream of shame and blame. Good people (those who can afford to stay home) and bad people (all the rest).  The shaming and blaming and moralizing continue to this day.  Pre-vaccine everything was the fault of libertines who would not stay home, and post vaccine everything is the fault of the unvaccinated.

>**4.     Tolerance & compassion has been replaced** by vaccine passports, and mandates, and passionate calls that people who decline vaccination should pay higher premiums, lose their jobs or not receive medical care! 

>Progressives have forgotten that the structures of society—our tribalism, our income inequality, our politics—trap people in information bubbles where they are not given open and honest information about vaccines. On the other side, there is a different bubble of dishonesty that won’t consider adverse effects fairly. I learned this the hard way, trying to talk about the benefit of vaccination while reducing the risk of myocarditis.

>**In short, for each pillar of progressivism that once existed, we instead have the precise opposite sentiment among self-proclaimed liberals.**

>A full analysis of the origin of this swing is beyond me, but it is undeniable that many people were anchored to Donald J. Trump. Whatever he said, we did the opposite. That is evident by massive opinion poll swings in school re-openings the moment he said we ought to do them, documented by Vlad Kogan.

>That was the original sin. Closing schools for so long in Democratic stronghold cities, strong union cities, precisely after the President that many disliked pushed for [them to be open].

And the net result has been **devastation so catastrophic it will shape this country for the next 100 years, if we survive it**.

 Hasel-Paris Alvarez

### THE TRIBUNE

# The murder of socialism at the hands of progressivism

## Has progressivism allied itself with capitalism against the common people? According to Hasel-Paris Álvarez, workers today endure a double exploitation: the capitalist economic hierarchy and the progressive moral hierarchy.

&#x200B;

First, a definition. Socialism was born as the requirement to distribute among the people ( *sociare* ) the property that a few concentrate in their hands. His approach is that **there is a war of capitalism against the workers** and that the former grows at the expense of the latter.

So far, the reader can ideologically agree or not. It is possible that he identifies more with the right: that everything ends up being owned by Facebook or Amazon is natural, because the big fish must eat the little one. 

Perhaps the reader does not believe in the class struggle, no matter how much the billionaire **Warren Buffet** admits that it exists, also specifying that they (the rich) are winning.

There are even those who do not even believe in *the people* or *society* (and, therefore, neither in socialism), arguing that there is only the sovereignty of the individual.

But however you think, the reader will surely accept the definition of socialism that we have just given. Or at least one very similar. And yet it is the self-proclaimed heirs of socialism who have altered (and even reversed) these definitions!

### From the class struggle to the struggles of all kinds

Progressivism claims, to varying degrees, that socialism renounces the centrality of the capital-labor conflict. The class struggle has given way to a string of conflicts that they call *struggles* : animalism, self-determination, indigenism, multiculturalism ...

*Luchas* is one of those plurals that, instead of adding, subtracting. Remember **Arnaldo Otegi** speaking of *republics* , the European Union of *justice* , **Irene Montero** of *women* or **Juan Ramón Rallo** of *equalities* and *freedoms* . 

>""The Rosa Luxemburg, Clara Zetkin or Aleksándra Kollontai did not believe in feminism as a women's movement beyond social class""

But the republic only makes sense when it unites the different, justice only exists when it is one and, in the same way, either there is a single main struggle or it will run the risk of being diluted between many fronts. He who covers much little squeezes, says the proverb.

It is not about giving up just causes, but that the trees do not prevent us from seeing the forest. The classic theories of socialism consider that the other systems of oppression (patriarchal, territorial, caste) have been abolished with the arrival of the capitalist system or absorbed by it, so that only the defeat of capitalism can end the rest of injustices.

The **Rosa Luxemburg** , **Clara Zetkin** or **Aleksándra Kollontai** did not believe in feminism as a women's movement beyond social class.

Regarding the *open borders* and the *refugees welcome* , **Karl Marx himself** wrote that, as long as capitalism exists, immigration serves to lower wages and divide the working class. And he suggests in *El Capital* that the environmental cause is also subordinate to the fight against capitalism: the bourgeois system was the cause of the ""metabolic rupture between man and earth (...) simultaneously depleting natural and human resources.""

The problem with modern progressivism is that it surrenders in this fight against capitalism, **accepting it from a social democratic perspective** (even socioliberal), but constantly insisting on eradicating all *hate crimes* and *symbolic discrimination* .

For progressivism, capitalism would be, at best, a system of domination among many others: patriarchy (exercised by men), binaryism (also exercised by men, but this time in alliance with women), Eurocentrism (exercised by men, women and even non-binaries born in the West) or speciesism **(already exercised by men, women, binaries, ternaries and all humanity in general)** .

Thus, the enemy is no longer limited to 1% of large capitalists and extends to the last of the mortals. In the end, the framework of progressivism bears little resemblance to that of socialism and very much to that of liberalism: all against all.

### It's not the market, my friend 

The next step for progressivism is to consider that capitalism is not exactly one more oppression, but the least of all of them. This is how the theories of the new left appear that consider capitalism as a mere addition to some evils that began in the Paleolithic: social hierarchies, religion, the army or national groups.

It was already difficult to fight against the *homo economicus* of the last centuries as to also fight against the *homo sapiens* of all the millennia. There are also feminist ideas that, twisting the texts of **Friedrich Engels** , put capitalism as a child of patriarchy: the macho system would have been the first to create private property and establish a class struggle between both sexes.

Therefore, it will not make sense to abolish usury until the genders can be abolished (that is to say: never).

>""The priority is that Extremadura apologize for having extracted American silver in the 16th century. And, if possible, that they apologize to Mexicans such as the millionaire Carlos Slim, a Blackrock shareholder""

Decolonial theories deserve special mention. Capitalism would only be one phase of the medieval and renaissance empires. The liberals understand it just the opposite of **Lenin** (imperialism as a phase of capitalism).

**Aníbal Quijano** , for example, claimed that the Spanish Empire would have been the origin of all capitalism, racism and sexism. The Aztec Empire, on the other hand, would have been a pioneer of equality, [since it sacrificed equally men and women, older and younger, rich and poor](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/07/06/archaeologists-discover-a-gruesome-tower-of-skulls-in-mexico-city) .

For these theories, [that Blackrock is extracting minerals from Extremadura is a secondary question](https://www.expansion.com/empresas/2020/09/04/5f516c91468aebf1218b459d.html) . The priority would be that Extremadura themselves apologize for having extracted American silver in the 16th century. And, if possible, that they apologize to Mexicans like the millionaire **Carlos Slim** , shareholder of the aforementioned Blackrock. 

The final station of this progressivism is to deny the very existence of capitalism. This is how **Sofía Castañón** , Secretary for Feminisms of United We Can, wrote on Twitter : ""Hey, white-cis-hetero male, show us who oppresses you, we can't see it!""

In other words, there would be no exploitation for the majority of the Spanish working class (54% male, 80% white, 90% cishetero).

Another example: **Pablo Simón** ( [political scientist at Más País](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E46Od-9HsjY) ) thinks that, since there are fewer industrial manual workers than in the last century, class consciousness no longer mobilizes the current precarious, unemployed, office workers and small self-employed. Therefore, the left should forget about the capital-labor conflict and choose to become bohemian-bourgeois (or as they say in Spain, posh-progressive), turning to fresher, more identity, more eco-lesbo-indigenist issues.

Simón and his people believe (sincerely!) That convincing a *rider* that he is working class is a greater difficulty than convincing him that masculinity is toxic, [the future is to eat insect salad](https://www.esdiario.com/opinion/648740458/psoe-aragon-promueve-consumo-de-gusanos.html) , Franco is going to return, vandalize the The statue of Columbus is fair, girls have penises and hares run through the sea. 

### Inclusive Capitalism: Higher Stage of Progressivism

Progressivism is no longer interested in the old revolutionary subject (that of **Julio Anguita** : the union of trade unionists, social democrats, communists and base Christians). The new progressive revolutionary subject will consist mainly of  [""women, migrants, gays, lesbians, trans, black, yellow and brown""](https://ctxt.es/es/20190710/Firmas/27185/soberanismo-globalismo-georges-soros-migrantes-emmanuel-rodriguez-nuria-alabao.htm) , in an intersectional axis with "" **Greta Thunberg** , an adolescent feminist, [a ten-year-old trans](https://www.eldiario.es/opinion/zona-critica/sujeto-politico-revolucionario-nina-trans_129_6081601.html) "" and with the nucleus irradiator *trans-fag-bun-queer* . Because the alliance of workers, peasants and working intellectuals was too hard to explain!

>""What if capitalism was actually an ally (more or less uncomfortable) in the fight against cis-hetero-patriarchies and white-Christian-colonial privilege?""

Then, as Amazon prepares a section of Black Lives Matter products, Uber launches a vegan food section and the *Forbes* financial newsletter promotes the trans activist **Elizabeth Duval** , a new idea arises within the progressivism. What if capitalism was actually an ally (more or less uncomfortable) in the fight against cis-hetero-patriarchies and white-Christian-colonial privileges? What if the fullness of the new revolutionary subject was to unite *black, yellow and brown* with the Benetton brand, put *Greta and the girls* in a Netflix documentary or put the *queer-bun-queer thing* on a Vodafone float? [This is the Biden formula](https://www.elespanol.com/mundo/america/20210210/sombra-arcoiris-esconde-gobierno-diverso-america/557814223_12.html), so applauded by **Yolanda Díaz** and **Irene Montero** . 

For capitalism it is very easy to be part of the progressive revolutionary subject. It is the system with the fastest adaptation speed: it does not cost anything to incorporate more women to the boards of directors, to give more weight in the organization of trade to an Arab sheikh or a Chinese *Forbes* , or to announce new LGBT millionaires in the aforementioned *Forbes* .

It is the so-called *inclusive capitalism* of the World Economic Forum, **whose agenda is followed to the letter by the progressive governments of the world** . The same gap between the richest and the poorest (or even greater), but now with more *diversity* , more pronouns and more green. 

As the *new* left and the *new* capitalism unite, they need to define a common enemy. That adversary is the common people: those that **Castañón** described as ""white-cis-hetero males"", but also including all women, *racialized* and LGTB people who do not submit to progressivism. All enemies, traitors, alienated: the woman who wants to perpetuate the horrible exploitation that is the family, the immigrant who has the Spanish flag on the balcony, [the homosexual who complains about the menas](https://twitter.com/EduardoChaperon/status/1432048893756379144) and the insecurity of citizens.

This enmity comes from the fact that, unlike capitalism, the working class is *slow to adapt* , being the main obstacle to progressivism.

The trucker's need to drive for days on end makes him a dangerous polluter. 

**The waiter's overtime prevents him from studying the gender perspective necessary to know who to serve the beer and to whom the soda** . 

The high electricity bill prevents the neighbor from saving to buy an electric Tesla.

The old age of the grocer on the corner makes it difficult for him to understand why now the costumes he sold at Carnival are racist and the toys he sold at Christmas are sexist.

This is the highest phase of progressivism: the class struggle turned upside down. **Now, the left is fighting big capital and targeting the lower-middle classes** . And workers endure double exploitation: the capitalist economic hierarchy and the progressive moral hierarchy.

**This is how socialism dies at the hands of progressivism** .

265,qwcr4w,Khaki_Banda,Progressive Shia: What does Progressivism mean to you?,"As-salam alai’kum Shia sis’s and bros,

From my perspective, just as sunnis are supposed to accept other maddhabs as alternative valid viewpoints, I tend to apply the same thinking to Ibadis and Shi’a as well. It seems to me that each maddhab, including hanafis, malikis, hanbalis, shafi’is, zahiris, ibadis, and jafaris (shia) have at least internally-consistent viewpoints. I can see bases for truth and sound reasoning within each one of them, even if I do not always agree with their conclusions.

I can see how sunnis justify being progressive: largely by drawing from across a variety of legal schools and diverse opinions of scholars both living and long-dead. Since it is technically permissible to take an eclectic approach, this works for us.

However, as I understand it (and please correct me!) most Shia are part of marjas (“sources”) of authority, each based around an ayatollah who has been given authority to exercise ijtihad (independent legal reasoning). You are supposed to draw all legal opinions from that source, not mixing opinions, and cannot follow the opinions of a dead scholar (unless the current one you are following dies, then you can continue to follow them). I glean this mainly from reading r/shia. I am not trying to tell you what Islam means to you, just trying to understand, no judgement or offense intended!

So, I have a few questions, if you don't mind sharing your thoughts:

1. How does being progressive work for Shia? How do you justify progressive viewpoints from a Shia perspective?
2. Are there any progressive marjas that you follow? (progressive like Javed Ghamidi, El Fadl, Shabir Ally, Abu Layth, Shehzad Saleem, Adnan Ibrahim-type “progressive”)
3. Do you reject adhering to a single marja, or recognize sources of knowledge outside of your marja?
4. How do you feel about minority (non-twelver) groups generally considered Shia, such as Ismailis, Aga Khanis, and Alevis? Would you consider them relatively progressive?
5. How do progressive shia scholars like Mohsen Kadivar fit into the wider landscape of Shia thought? How about Ali Shariati?

Obviously, there are many progressive Shia, so I am absolutely not suggesting you cannot be Shia and be progressive, just wondering what your justifications and thought processes are within your religious viewpoint? Hopefully this will also help bring greater understanding of Shia perspectives on this sub, and help discussions to be more inclusive of your viewpoints.

Please, no sunni-shia hate in the comments. We are all Muslims here.

283,qj7vuh,Pixelwind,We should be trying to co-opt progressivism,"**Why:**

Progressive doesn't really have a specific definition so we should be working to define it as explicitly anti-capitalist. There are more progressives than in a long time and working to change what progressive means would have a large positive impact on the ideals of those who claim to be progressive.

**Where:**

Progressive pages on social media are a great place to do this because lots of progressives view and interact with them and lots of right wingers join the discussion essentially providing free fodder to get progressives to side with you when you point out flaws in their beliefs (progressives love seeing right wing beliefs proven wrong with data/logic). We should avoid overtly establishment pages like pro joe biden pages because it's not worth the time. The goal is to proseltyze progressives who will then talk to family members/friends to slowly shift their views as well.

**How:**

Posting ""history lessons"" about leftist figures who progressives can find common ground with then shifting to how their leftist beliefs have been intentionally left out of most discussions is a great one since there are so many to choose from.

Another good way is to provide agreeable criticisms of capitalism and explicitly associate them with capitalism itself rather than more nebulous terms like greed or corruption.

Really anything that furthers class consciousness in a way that won't feel scary to progressives.

Avoid edgy memes and the word communism until the majority of the group identifies as socialist. Avoid long memes, text-posts can be long, memes should be short and use terminology that progressives understand. Memes that use leftist terminology will generally not be understood and will fall flat, It is very easy to convey the same exact ideas using layman's terminology so we should do that instead and occasionally educate about leftist terminology when necessary.

A relatively small group of leftists in a relatively large progressive page can without much trouble shift the internal overton window of the page and that shift usually persists even if those leftists leave since the beliefs of page members have shifted with it. Even singular but dedicated leftists can drastically shift the political ideology of a page/group if they use methods that are palatable to progressives and post often enough.

Conservatism is a natural style of thinking, and that is the problem; our innate nature is riddled with biased and irrational thinking, that while helped us survived to this point, cannot influence advanced thinking the future requires. The nuclear family is a ""nice"" idea, but it has also been why we have had half the number of scientist and philosophers in history - or at least why most of female thinkers haven't been properly reported on. Unfortunately academics and science have been patriarchal at its core, some argue still is (I don't believe that or want to). 

Transgenderism:

Too many atheist and *skeptics* sound no better than far right conservatives. While you can't deny science, science is merely a tool and shouldn't be used to define us. Body Morphic Freedoms is a key tenet of transhumanism; the freedom to design yourself anyway you want, and that goes beyond gender. 

Religion:

""Religion is cancer get rid of it"" as an already movement of outliers, there should be ability to understand the psychology of why humans want to be religious rather than hostility towards the belief systems. Dogmas are bad but thats our instinct to find and cling to them. I think atheism isnt progressive but rather prevents progress, that is to find common ground. As generations move forward religious beliefs will not be stopping technoprogressions as much as the prejudice held between belief holders.

334,pcbtjc,hardcore_gamer1,Progressivism was created as a pseudo-idealogy for bigots,"But the so-called progressives are much smarter than traditional bigots, in that they are savvy enough to always frame their prejudices as standing up for 'less privileged groups', whereas traditional bigots are more direct in their hostility. 

Basically the only difference between progressive bigotry and traditional bigotry is that progressives are better at marketing. 

Ex:

**Traditional bigot:** *""I hate that Jews are greedy and horde all the money at the expense of the rest of us.""*

**Progressive*****:*** *""I hate that jews have obtained their wealth via a system of unearned privilege at the expense of more disadvantaged groups.*"" 

Notice how they are saying the same thing. Both of the above claims:

\-That jews horde money.

\-That jews don't deserve their wealth.

\-That jewish wealth comes at the expense of non-jews. 

There is no difference between plain bigotry and progressive ideology, except only for framing and wording. 

Another example:

**Traditional bigot:** I don't want more jewish CEOs

**Progressive:** I want more non-jews CEOs. 

They both want the same thing, but the difference is once again framing. *""Oh no, I don't want the jews gone. I just want more of our own guys in...which incidentally means having to throw all the jews out....""*

The traditional racist gets called out as such because his language is vulgar. But the progressive is savvy enough to frame his bigotry as being something else. In actual fact, he just hates jews just like the other bigot does, but is clever enough to choose his words better.

You can take literally any racist position or argument and then reword it using progressive language.    

Progressivism is just a mask for bigots that are smart enough to care about their public image, and who understand the importance of distancing themselves away from more overt bigots, who are too stupid to understand what they look like to other people. 

And before you ask why this belongs at r/conspiracy it's because:

A: This would probably get banned everywhere else cus reddit. 

B: It sort of counts as a conspiracy, seeing as progressivism has been sold to the masses under false pretenses where as traditional racism is no longer as mainstream.",2021-08-26 19:03:43,0
335,mgmh59,historymajor44,"Historian Jack Balkin believes that in the wake of Trump's defeat, we are entering a new era of constitutional time where progressivism is dominant. Do you agree?","Jack Balkin wrote and recently released [The Cycles of Constitutional Time](https://www.amazon.com/Cycles-Constitutional-Time-Jack-Balkin/dp/0197530990#:~:text=In%20The%20Cycles%20of%20Constitutional,polarization%2C%20and%20alternating%20episodes%20of)

He has categorized the different eras of constitutional theories beginning with the Federalist era (1787-1800) to Jeffersonian (1800-1828) to Jacksonian (1828-1865) to Republican (1865-1933) to Progressivism (1933-1980) to Reaganism (1980-2020???)

He argues that a lot of eras end with a failed one-term president.  John Adams leading to Jefferson.  John Q. Adams leading to Jackson.  Hoover to FDR.  Carter to Reagan.  He believes Trump's failure is the death of Reaganism and the emergence of a new second progressive era.  

Reaganism was defined by the insistence of small government and the nine most dangerous words.  He believes even Clinton fit in the era when he said that the ""era of big government is over.""  But, we have played out the era and many republicans did not actually shrink the size of government, just run the federal government poorly.  It led to Trump as a last-ditch effort to hang on to the era but became a failed one-term presidency.  Further, the failure to properly respond to Covid has led the American people to realize that sometimes big government is *exactly* what we need to face the challenges of the day.  He suspects that if Biden's presidency is successful, the pendulum will swing left and there will be new era of progressivism.

338,pes0lm,MerlynTrump,(politics monday?) Should the Church condemn progressivism,"I was reading this article about[""resisting the prohibition temptation"".](https://spectator.org/resist-the-prohibition-temptation/)  and how the alleged social evils of alcohol were used to justify the restrictions on liberty that was prohibition and it got me thinking.

First off by the Church I mean the Pope or some department of the curia (probably CDF) issuing a document of some sort. In the article there is a line that "" The idea that centralized national power could cure every societal ill was a mainstay of progressivism "". 

By condemning progressivism I don't mean so much temporary things that current political progressives tend to support like abortion or gay marriage. I'm thinking of two more centralized ideas of progressivism that I believe conflict with Church teaching but are central to progressive ideology. The first idea is that there is this ""march of history"" and that change or progress is something that is always good, that because a given idea is more popular than it was in the past it must be right (you can see this for example in the way a lot of current progressives discuss gay marriage or in the ""the future is female"" slogan). The other idea is the one mentioned in the article I link, that  the centralized power of the federal government (or even international institutions) should be used to cure social ills and to subordinate civil society and the Church to the fight against whatever particular ill the government or the progressive movement wants to fight (like today we see with all the ""anti-racist"" stuff that exploded after George Floyd died).",2021-08-30 16:48:05,4

Perhaps progressives in the midwest should follow this example to win greater support for other issues, especially if they can do so without upsetting their core base.

Increased acceptance of marginalized communities (LGBT groups, racial minorities, new or previously rejected schools of thought/understanding, religious minorities, etc.) increased representation of those groups in media are what stick out to me more than a decade after learning about it.

The cultural push against it, from what I recall, involved a conservative coalition of religious groups, disenfranchised young men upset with the cultural shift they were seeing among their peers, and nationalists blaming these new ideas and developments for ruining the country, among other groups. 

How well does my understanding fit in to the realities for pre-Nazi Germany? Obviously there were economic and political concerns impacting these groups, and it's impossible to divorce the two from social concerns, but is it generally fair to say

Joe Manchin is a Republican. Bipartisanship was a mistake. Progressives in the house better ratfuck Republicans out of the bipartisan bill.

- Kid fantasy shows like She-Ra or Wildcats have been eaten up and shat out like SJW vehicle turds. 

- Whenever a fantasy property from a non-woke author gets adapted, its somehow woke like Witcher, GoT, Wheel of Time and soon Amazon's LoTR. 

- Ancient mythology also gets that treatment like Hades, with PoC Patroclus, Ares and Athena.

- Video games like Dragon Age are at the forefront of Fantasy, even though the last entry and its fans seem more obsessed about romances, woke characters and goofy nonsense. 

And then we have our very own sub reddit about fantasy, which seemingly puts secondary priority to discussing fantasy, but first and foremost priority to Woke stuff. Threads that get most awards and upvotes are always something about LGBT, Women(and rape),PoC people etc... Recently a lot of visitors there got really triggered cause a fantasy author had ""good"" cops( a lot of nuance escaped them, but its a long story). And totally woke authors are on constant assault for being racist, sexist and you name it.

We have so many examples of conservative religious terror organizations, one big example is taliban. Why there are not any big terror organizations which want to do exactly opposite, i.e. spread atheism, progressivism etc, through terror?

At beginning, the founders of taliban like organizations think that, modern culture is destroying the religion and tradition, they look around and get angry after seeing ""degenerate"" modern things like women working freely, liberal laws, democracy etc. Then they think, ""Killing them all is the only way"".

Why can't there be a progressive group of people who think that, backward religious stuff is stopping our progress to the better life, they look around and get angry after seeing ""ridiculous"" traditional things like, women staying at home, strict religious laws, theocracy etc and compare them to the progressive countries of the west, and then think, ""Killing them all is the only way""?

Also, can we compare the reign of terror of robespierre in france to a ""progressive terror regime"" about which I am talking here?

413,r454ng,OddGuidance907,CMV: we should stop using the term “Latinx”,"I admit it will be very difficult to change my view as I feel very strongly on this but I am open to reconsidering my view.

1. The term is completely unpronounceable in Spanish the way that people intend for it to be pronounced. If the people for whom the word is intended cannot even pronounce it, then it is not an effective solution.

2. “Latino” is gender neutral in Spanish already but if that is unacceptable because of its masculine inclination for some people then there are other alternatives that are easier to pronounce such as “Latine” and “Latin.” In Spanish, it is understood that “Latino” is gender neutral and it does not have the sexist connotation that English-speakers assume it does. 

3. The term is largely pushed by progressive white Americans against the will of the Latino community in the US. Only 3% of Latinos in the US identify with the term according to the Pew Research Center, the vast majority have not even heard of it, and amongst those who have their view of it is overwhelmingly negative. They see it as a white Western attempt to disrespect the rules of the Spanish language for politicized means, which is linguistic imperialism. 

4. Given the number of people who actually use the term being so small, it should not be used as the default for all Latinos unlike what corporations and politicians in the US are doing. If you know someone identifies as a woman or a man just call them Latino or Latina. 

5. We often say people are the authors of their own experience and this is a central tenet of progressivism especially for the marginalized. So why are people NOT listening to the majority of Latinos who do not want to be called Latinx? It screams “we know what is better for you than you know for yourself so sit back and shut up.”",2021-11-28 08:10:47,4726

445,oykufn,tungster24,A Criticism of your beliefs about Progressivism,"I would like to talk about the problems, at least in my opininon about what you think about progressivism.

First of all, you seem to have created this sort of ""boogeyman"" about progressivisim and you seem to bring up this boogeyman any time someone tries to defend progressivism. From what I can see your main worries about progressivisim is that it leads to degeneracy.

Part I: Define Degeneracy

You say degeneracy without really saying much else. This leaves some open threads, and doesn't really give me much to work with. From what I can assume though, in your opinion it leads to a promiscuity beyond acceptability. I would like to know what you exactly mean but ""promiscuity"" is a more well-defined term. Oh by the way you probably want to say ""promiscuity"" anyways since saying degeneracy gives some really unpleasant tones about your views.

Part II: The boogeyman is a boogeyman

Progressivism's most general goal is to push forward equality (and for most people with a few exceptions) and also to push forward ""improved"" (highly subjective) beliefs. This is about as bare-bones are you're going to get with a definition. That's it. That's all progressivisim is. Now in the western world this might have been warped, this is not something I want to focus on. For most people progressivism is just: ""equality and rights for all"". That's literally it. This sort of ""SJW fake-race equality"" stuff you tend to talk about is a small minority, a very very vocal fringe minority, but a minority nonetheless. You've seemed to get so afraid of this progressivisim that you same seem to be very vocal against your hate against us, even thinking about violence from what it seems.

Part III: Your ways are flawed

If you want to convince people, just saying ""progressiv sux"" and ""progressive led to degeneracee"" is not going to be enough, I am honestly making this as just a stub post, and mostly just want to discuss with you. I want you to:

For context, I'd like to meet more Chad socialists like all of you outside of Reddit, I've met this girl that claim to be socialists saying ""*Shouldn't we be talk about the aesthetics that porn industry is shoving down our throats? The cirurgies that woman are taking leaves then with exactly the body presented on the porn industry.*""

This woman believed that other woman were being forced to take surgery because some person posted porn on the internet. And most incredible, that the body of the porn actress created it own demand just by being on the internet, aka Say's law.

That men would be influenced by porn and change their personal preference to fit the porn industry, not the porn industry that changed the porn actresses to fit the demand.

And most surprisingly is that other socialists, I saw a few that had ML in their profiles, were bashing in her for not being enough progressive, that these woman taking surgeries were actually trans woman that didn't like their bodies, and that bashing on body surgeries is heteronormative oppression.

I felt my brain melting while seeing ""*socialists*"" having this debate rather than plotting how to take over the means of production and abolishing money and the state.

I miss the old revolutionary type that is against the state and against capitalism, rather than being pro equality.

Quick note: not that I'm against woman or gay, my point is that there are more important things to do inside the socialist community other than debating identity politics, like overthrowing the bourgeois and seizing the means of production.

“When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said, in Alice Through the Looking Glass, “it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.” So liberals now call themselves “progressives.” The term ‘progressive’ stems from the word ‘progress,’ and progress connotes change. “A little change never hurt,” said R.P.

Storytime:

I'm in a local group where a homeless encampment was destroyed, one of the reasons behind such being that it was a group of homeless men making women feel unsafe, approaching and harassing them and such. A woman states her experience with having been chased by a homeless men on several occasions and while she hates getting rid of encampments without having a viable place to put people, she gets it from a public safety perspective since she's been on the receiving end.

Cue the scrotes invalidating her experience.

Then, like clockwork, cue the cool girls coming in saying that ""Well, fuck your comfort and safety, think about the homeless men!"" Gaslighting galore.

Meanwhile, when asked what the fuck did they plan on doing to protect said women? Silence. But they got lots of likes on their posts!

Ladies, you should know that there are absolutely women willing to sell you out if it means that they get the attention and good feels of the men, and if it makes them look morally superior. Their need to look on a higher level and better than everyone else means that you will be collateral damage. Our right to exist safely and to advocate for such is considered a bridge too far. I consider myself to be politically far to the left myself, but seeing the amount of fuckery going on leftist circles and how women are so ignored and taken for granted is giving me a migraine.",2021-04-08 12:38:57,179

476,o4xk0e,Aristox,"How TYT has changed over the last ~5 years, and why it's a loss for progressivism","I used to watch TYT religiously, back in 2014-2016. But after that I saw them compromise on their original leftist and progressive values and pivot to supporting the woke movement even in places where that is in contradiction to genuine leftist, liberal, progressive values and principles.

Since that pivot, they've gone more and morr towards clickbait, culture war antagonism, and virtue signalling, while continuing to sacrifice intellectual and journalistic integrity.

They should have been able to explore their belief in russiagate while still having Jimmy Dore on their team arguing the opposite case. That's what the old TYT would have done. But the fact that they found Jimmy's disbelief in Russiagate so intolerable that it lead to him having to leave and go independent says a lot about how their standards and values have changed as they got more and more swung over to the fundamentalist woke worldview rather than their original liberal progressive worldview

Throwing Jordan Chariton under the bus despite him not actually doing anything wrong is also a huge red flag. He never mistreated anyone, but simply because he was a straight man dating a lot of women, he was considered a big red flag for a sexist woke culture in the era of #metoo. Without any credible accusations of having actually done anything bad, he was fired from TYT just because his partying lifestyle was considered suspicious by a culture that demanded straight men be passive and unambitious. That's crazy, and showed the leadership of TYT had fully transitioned from a moderate woke position to a full on extremist position that includes misandrist demonisation of straight men *per se*, regardless of any actual bad behaviour

That was a few years ago now and they've just continued to fall in real moral standing as far as i can tell- these direct smears on Aaron and Jimmy, and Ana's recent attempt to blackmail Jimmy being clear proof of how far they've fallen and just how much they've compromised on their original principles.

And I havent even mentioned the tens of millions of dollars they've taken in from establishment democrat organisations and donors. There was a time not too long ago when Cenk had a very clear argument about why taking donor money from the ruling class can open you to corruption.

It's a real shame, because TYT was well positioned to be the home of progressives. But as far as i can tell they've squandered that opportunity and turned into an online MSNBC. Cenk's origin story is that he originally quit that organisation to focus on building TYT to be fundamentally different, but it seems that most of his staff now would be right at home there cause they're basically running the same playbook at TYT",2021-06-21 10:21:08,0

How much do you agree with this statement and why?","While I have met plenty of socialists with ""woke"" or otherwise progressive viewpoints, the capitalists I've met seem to have more varied social views. In what ways would capitalism be useful for promoting social progressivism? Is socialism detrimental to progressivism in any way? When you say capitalism benefits marginalised groups, do you refer to private ownership of the means of production specifically, or just the market economy in general?",2021-07-16 06:10:49,4
