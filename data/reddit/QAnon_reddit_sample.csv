29,r3fqxq,wonderingpitmaster,I finally understand freedom. My escape from conservatism/qanon,"I will start out saying that I am 24 years old.

I got caught up in the conservative movement in 2016. I was brainwashed into supporting trump and just being a staunch maga supporter. I became semi famous on youtube and facebook for my extremist views of being a black conservative. I wanted a place to feel like i belong. I wanted to be part of something special. 

Over the time I had this feeling of something being wrong. It was a nagging gut feeling that, I was caught in a cult. It was like being in a hivemind. In 2017 I began to hear about this Q anon thing. I paid no attention to it and i thought it was weird. Suddenly I began to listen to it. At first it seemed as if it made sense. I felt like i finally cracked the code(so i thought) to why things were the way they were.

I felt like i had some secret knowledge. In truth i was stupid. For 2 years 2018-2020. I was somewhat heavy into Q anon. Then something broke in me. That same feeling came back. 

The feeling of being in a deadly cult. I felt like i was part of the modern day branch davidians. If i thought differently, i was insulted and berated. I got called liberal, fake, idiot, and other things that i wish to no repeat on here. I felt alone. 

I began to ""deprogramme"" around late 2020 to early this year. I started to talk to and ask doctors about the vaccine and the science behind it. I asked politicians and business owners about the political aspects of america. I asked my friends, family, and coworkers the same questions. As i asked around, i slowly began to come to my senses. 

I began to realize how, extreme and radical i became. I lost friends, family members, good romantic relationships all because of my actions and viewpoints. The world wasnt against me. I was against the world. I was at war with myself. 

I realized how brainwashed these q anon people were. How flawed their world view was. I feel like i wasted my youth. I wish i never even met these people. I regret my decisions and i miss my old self. 

I used to be such a nice person. I loved anime(and I still do), i treated everyone equally. I wasnt always angry or depressed. I wasnt a flaming racist(even though im black), nor was I a ""redpilled"" person.

2021 has been a year of deprogramming myself. I spat that redpill up and became somewhat normal.
I dont see myself being radical anymore. That mindset changed and as a result my life changed for the better. I met new friends, and reunited with old ones. I found myself being less angry, and less depressed. 

I see the world in a completely different light. 

Thank God i am able to atleast spend the rest of my youth at peace with myself, and with others.

Sorry for the long explanation. I just had to vent out my journey and my walk away from conservatism/qanon.",2021-11-27 09:25:42,2866

Weeks after they [**first gathered near Dealey Plaza**](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2021/11/02/qanon-supporters-gather-in-downtown-dallas-expecting-jfk-jr-to-reappear/), dozens of believers in the furthest fringe of the QAnon conspiracy theory remain in Dallas, expecting long-dead John F. Kennedy Jr. to reveal himself in the city where [**his father was assassinated**](https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/pop-culture/2021/11/22/jfk-assassination-8-strange-details-about-kennedys-1961-lincoln-continental-limousine/) and usher in the reinstatement of Donald Trump as president.

While their beliefs are patently absurd, the fervency and devotion of this particular group, along with their loyalty to a leader known as Negative48 and unwillingness to leave Dallas, is unique — and cause for alarm and concern, according to an expert who has followed QAnon for years.

“I think what you’re seeing here is really, undeniably a cult,” said Mike Rothschild, author of [***The Storm Is Upon Us***](http://static.mhpbooks.com/the-storm-is-upon-us/), which chronicles the rise of, and fallout from, QAnon.

59,r4m3j9,EuphoricTrilby,"Why is the left so obsessed with ""QAnon""?","Aside from J6, QAnon is something the left loves to say when they lose an argument. And for whatever reason, r/politics and such are (pretending to be?) afraid of them. ""OMG look at all these QAnon candidates running in 2022! Boebart, MTG, AHHHH!!!""  

I asked the folks of the\_donald a while back, and most of them either have no idea or iffy answers at best. The only consistent answer is that it's multiple shit-posters who use the letter Q a lot on 4chan (where everyone is an anonymous ""Anon"").  Also, ""QAnon"" never ever ever gets mentioned on any of the conservative subs. 

[In the media](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/01/885991730/gop-candidates-open-to-qanon-conspiracy-theory-advance-in-congressional-races), it's basically used to describe anyone who believes that DC has a ""deep state"" (i.e. an unelected, permanent bureaucracy that remains in power, regardless of who's president). They accuse Boebart of being a ""QAnon"" candidate simply for agreeing with the idea that Russiagate was done by corrupt deep state operatives (which has since been proven to be definitively true by Durham). 

Anyways, just seems like a lot of self-gaslighting circlejerk that the folks of r/politics, and their brigaders to this sub, love to throw around. ""If you think that our dear government is corrupt and anti-democratic, we're gonna call you names!!!"" seems like the message here...

73,qh4ofk,augustgrace0505,Recovered QAnoner,"  

I’ve been reading some of these posts on here  and now I understand what my family was going through when I went down the Q rabbit hole. I am so embarrassed and ashamed. I never thought something like this could happen to me. Now looking back, I was in a very vulnerable place. If the pandemic never happened, I do not think I would have fallen down the rabbit hole.  

Here’s the abbreviated version of my Q indoctrination. March/April 2020, I saw a video on TikTok, saying, “hey I know you hate Trump, but he’s spearheading a global human trafficking ring. Please watch the documentary Out of Shadows.” I watched it and boom…all my social media algorithms carried me further and further down the rabbit hole.  Before you know it, you are living in an alternative reality. It’s painful at first, but then you start to accept these new “truths” and you find your tribe who are also “red pilled.” Here’s the interesting part with Q, it’s this nebulous entity, YOU are supposed to dissect the “Q drops” it’s like a do-it-yourself scavenger hunt. Q never said anything about anti-vax, flat earth, aliens, never going to the moon, etc. but somehow all fringe groups get lumped together under the one umbrella. It’s also worth noting, one doesn’t have to subscribe to all of it. My one friend thinks Trump is a time traveler and the royal family are reptiles. I was never that far gone, but I did think Trump was asked by the military to take down a pedo ring. Sounds insane, I know, but now looking back, I felt so uneasy having Trump as president, in a weird way this brought me comfort. He was asked by military to “save” the country.  Also, Trump played into this which brought further confirmation this was all true. For example, saying “I was chosen” … “I was part of the club, it was a nice club to be part of, now I’m not in it anymore.”  “It’s not me who they are after, it’s YOU, I’m just in the way.”  I can give so many more examples. Sometimes I wonder if he was indeed the mastermind behind all of this.   

The Q grip started to lose its reign over me when Biden was inaugurated. However, I then shifted my focus on the vaccine. I became very anti-vax, even at one point saying, “I will NEVER take this vaccine let them fire me.""  My work mandated the vaccine, I field an exemption and they honored it. This was my aha moment. My “freedom” was not being taken away and then I asked myself, “why am I so against this vaccine?” I decided to turn off all social media. I reached out to former colleagues and friends, “hey are you vaccinated” vast majority of them were (no one had any adverse reactions). I reached out to doctors I know and trusted, they strongly encouraged the vaccine and explained it to me. I knew these doctors were not part of the ""deep state"" or paid actors. How insane I even have to say this!

That was the moment I said to myself, “I think I am in a Trump/Q cult.” Everything began to unravel. I slowly started to reconnect back to reality and got fully vaccinated! I was hoping to get better cell service…you know 5G…but that has not happened yet nor is Bill Gates controlling my thoughts. Making jokes helps me to process it all. I cannot believe how insane I was. I am so happy now and I am no longer paranoid or having to search for the “secret” meaning of everything.

I’ve tried to pull a few people out. I shared my experience with them and how we got hoodwinked…my testimony falls on deaf ears. You must realize there is so much emotional and psychological time invested in these conspiracies. It is very painful and scary for them to let it go. I’ve been reading up on cults, Dr. Steve Hassan, is a great resource for helping to deprogram loved ones who are in cults, he said the person must feel like they are in control. By me asking myself, “why am I so against this vaccine.” I was in control. I ***decided*** to look for answers. 

I believe Q was created by gamers, maybe former military intelligence, and possibly outside interference, who knows maybe even Trump himself played a part in it or maybe some guy living in their mom's basement.  Furthermore, it does not help that a certain cable “news” network and politicians validate these conspiracies. For example, MK Ultra is a big conspiracy Q people are into. Allegedly the CIA gave people LSD to try to program their thoughts. One night, Tucker Carlson, says (I’m paraphrasing) “now the government is mandating a vaccine; what’s next, acid?” He knew  these words would trigger a certain response, it will create paranoia and more disbelief in the vaccines.  I thought to myself, you jerk, you’re most likely vaccinated as is most at Fox, and you’re manipulating your audience thinking their part of an experiment and their liberties are being taken way.  

Please be patient with your loved ones. I read someone on here suggest as whole family you can all detox from social media for a month. Go outside. I think that’s a great idea! I’m not sure if telling them facts will help at this point. Maybe reading up on cults and how to deprogram people would be helpful because it truly is a cult!

Like I said before, your loved one needs to feel like they’re in control. I asked a question which led me to finding answers by reaching out to people I trust. If someone told me I was in a cult…I would have thought “no sheep, you are.”",2021-10-27 14:37:00,2246

80,r14xz8,ItsABiscuit,Australian anime_titties users call out the amount of QAnon style rubbish being posted to the sub re Australia,"After the whole r/worldpolitics kerfuffle settled down, r/anime_titties had actually emerged as one of the better subs to discuss non-US centric current affairs.

That said, in the past few months, there's been a steady stream of articles posted about Australia's COVID response, many of which seem to buy into some of the more ""dubious"" claims originating in the US conservative media/YouTube/blog space.

In this piece, all the top responses are from people in Australia pointing out that the article is not well written or researched. One respondent here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/r0wufv/australian_army_forcibly_removing_covid19/hlvv9nz?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3

highlights the apparent drift off the sub towards posting more and more conspiracy style content.

Sorting by controversial also brings up a couple of individuals convinced this is Agenda 21 or the New World Order being implemented.

Meanwhile a slap fight breaks out about what brand of paternalism is best for Australian first nations peoples.

One person helpfully identifies its the lack of machine guns owned by Australians that allows the government to supposedly behave this way, but things get tetchy when another poster points out that Americans overwhelmingly use their guns to kill themselves rather than resist government overreach:

82,qykl8k,doomhalofan,I just found out a close friend of mine believes every single Qanon conspiracy and I'm still trying to process that information,"Sorry if this comes off as rambling. I'm still in utter shock and disappointment at what i thought was one of my best friends.


I won't say names for obvious reasons, but i think you'll understand who's who when I play out what happened.

So me and my friend play Xbox together all the time.
Him and i are both avid halo fans and we got the halo infinite multiplayer (beta? Idk if it's actually a beta or if it's here to stay) and as we were in the academy doing the training sequence, he just goes quiet the entire time. So i thought he was just focusing or whatever.

The training ends and he's still being silent, so i ask if he's okay. He said that he's sick with something so he doesn't want to talk as much because his throat hurts.

Alright, that's fine. I jokingly say he has Covid, and this is where shit just hit the fan

Me: bro you got Covid lol

Friend: Covid doesn't exist, what are you talking about?

At first i thought he was joking, so i just went along.

Me: oh shit you're right. Prolly one of the vaccine side effects lmao

Friend: I'm not vaccinated, so it's not that either.

Me: just so we're clear, I'm only making jokes.

Friend: I'm not. If you actually believe that Covid exists, then i hate to say it but Biden has completely brainwashed you. Don't ever trust a liberal dictator.

Me: wait wait, you weren't joking? When did you start believing this crap?

Friend: first of all, Qanon isn't crap. It's the truth. Second of all, I'm honestly really not starting to like you because you're a bisexual communist.


For context, a few weeks ago he went on a rant about how gays are the most destructive kind of people on the planet and that he couldn't wait for it to be outlawed again. When I first heard that, i honestly thought he was joking and we just left it at that.

I am bisexual, but not a full fledged communist. I'm a democratic socialist if you want to get into specifics, but that's a discussion for another time.


Me: what the fuck, i thought we were cool man?! The hell got into you?!

Friend: what got into me was that trump is our lord and savior, and that people like you are destroying this country. Trump will come back to office and create a United empire under his name, with all of the Jews, blacks, gays and liberals eradicated.

Me: so...you're saying you want me dead in the name of some old fuck who couldn't give less of a shit about you?

Friend: if that's how you want to see it, then yes.



I know he's not capable of violence himself because he can barely pick up a shotgun, so I'm not worried about that.

What i am is in complete shock because I never expected him to fall into this insanity. I'm probably not going to speak to him again. I'm really disappointed in him and am just...stunned that we were basically best friends for years, and now all of the sudden he wants me dead simply because I exist.


Idk, it's all just a lot for me to take in. Sorry if this felt like a rant or incoherent rambling.

I'm gonna go play Halo infinite by myself for a while",2021-11-20 20:08:58,406

84,qxp1jw,FRraANK,We've lost our parents to Qanon and they won't even meet our new born.,"To keep our new born safe as best we could we asked all friends and family to take a Covid Lateral Flow Test before visiting.

My parent in law's have spent 2 years during the pandemic sat in their home, alone, on YouTube and Facebook, absorbing all they can on Trump, Qanon and covid conspiracies.

They are changed people. But it's utterly tragic.

Our new arrival is 6 weeks old now, they refused to take an LFT test, haven't contacted or helped us in anyway (through what was a traumatic childbirth and recovery) or... met our gorgeous baby girl.

This is 100% due to their lack of digital literacy, the Facebook algorithm they took them further and further into the crazy.

At this point I don't think they can back down or their entire existence will collapse.

They live 200yds from us and all we can do is move away. 35+ years of relationship gone, and no grandparents dotting on our children.

So, fuck you Facebook.",2021-11-19 14:39:52,1244

98,qegsfg,Gustav017,"I am a former QAnon believer, thank God.","H**i**, my name is Gustav and I am a 20 year old italian guy that got wrapped up in this cult about a year ago. (Please, excuse my limited english skills)

I actually can't remember how I got in, but I sure do remember what I saw and how I felt. 

I wish I never saw those things.

This group is mostly 95% christians and 5% muslims and some atheists/agnostics too, the great majority clearly american, but there are also people from other countries (me, for example). I have nothing against christians since I am one myself, but what I saw is just absurd and it really traps you.

The problem is that you cannot stop ""learning"" the ""hidden truths"", you get addicted to it. First, they tell you that everything you believed to be real is a lie, and from that point you start discovering a lot of these ""secret truths"" that you are not supposed to know, and that produces *cognitive dissonance* (a very unpleasant feeling that occurs when your ideas that you held as true do not correspond with reality). But then you start accepting these ""truths"" and suddenly you are telling your parents/siblings/friends/relatives with absolute certainty that **the world is actually FLAT, space doesn't exist, jews control everything and they are the sole reason as to why evil exists, we are in the year 1021 and not 2021, Hitler was actually the good guy, jews were the responsibles for the bolshevik revolution, 9/11 was caused by jews, Nikola Tesla invented free energy but the jews captured him because they wanted to make people pay for energy, Nikola Tesla also invented a time machine and Donald Trump uses it to make sure everything is going ""according to plan"",** ***humans have the hidden ability of flight*****, there was a ""mudflood"" around 200 years ago that wiped out the ""Tartars"" (an ancient race of technologically advanced giant blonde people that built the cathedrals and every other gothic-styled building), black people are animals, asian people are demons, only white people can go to heaven, and pretty sure I'm missing some more disgusting things...**

A lot of them are **heavily** focused on race and on jewish people, I have seen several disgusting and sickening images and videos with very disturbing stuff in them, they are constantly announcing ""The Great Awakening"" that never comes, Donald Trump is some sort of messiah, and a large etc...

I am telling this to you all to see and know what your relatives are on about and to have a better perspective from a ex-follower like myself. There were times that what I was told was completely against my morals and ethics but I chose to believe it anyway... I completely regret it... 

I'm probably one of the rarest cases out there, but I simply snapped out of it, after months of following this cult I was like -""*WTF am I doing?!, why do I keep watching this stuff? Why do I keep giving into absurd and disgusting claims, why am I accepting that everyone is evil and everything is a lie?""-* 

These conspiracy theories make people miserable because it forces them to mistrust everyone and be in a constant and exhausting ""**alert**"" mode. I feel embarrased at the fact that I tried to explain to my own parents that the earth was flat... thank God they weren't so gullible like I was to believe it. 

They also fall in a contradiction: they say to us that we are ""sheep"" for believing the ""official narrative"" without researching, while they believe their own narrative without researching too! They believe everything their ""Q person"" says without question! 

Anyway, don't lose hope, there **is** a way out, but it may be different for each person. I snapped out of it, but your husband, dad, sibling, mom,... may be different, they may get bored and leave it, they may not see any evidence of their claims and eventually get out. I hope this does not happen but maybe they could get traumatized by something and leave... 

The most effective way, in my opinion, to make them leave is to debunk everything. All their claims are debunkable, they have to ask questions to educated and intelligent people. 

Conspiracies are very attractive to people because they are supposed to be ""forbidden"" truths that no one should know and human nature is easily tempted with ""forbidden"" stuff... 

Tell them that if there really was a conspiracy about extremely powerful and smart people, we should not be able to know about it and certainly we should not be able to discover how the secret world order works from the comfort of our homes, it's just absurd. 

It's already 2.00 AM here, thanks for reading and don't lose hope. Please.",2021-10-23 19:06:36,1758

158,qn7y16,appleparkfive,"I think Ethan is right about the QAnon deal, more so than Dan or some other people.","There's no Leftovers this week, but I think the talk in OTR is actually really important, despite it being mostly goofs.

I usually find myself siding with Dan on all sorts of things while watching (like a mental note, obviously. Not out loud), but... I think Ethan is spot on about QAnon. I think he's right about this in the same way he was right about covid.

In late 2019, when Wuhan was getting locked down, I was so confused why people didn't seem to be taking it seriously. I mean... China shutting down a city with the same amount of people as New York City, and people seemed oddly calm about that. Ethan was one of the few people who seemed sincerely worried about it in late 2019, of whom I saw speak about it (aside from the news). Plenty of ""aged like milk"" videos of basically every podcast and talk show on that one.

But again, I think he's right about QAnon being a MUCH bigger deal than people are seeing it. This isn't about my views, but more about hoping people (including Dan) also take it seriously. 

Because I mean... there's always been crazy people. Yes. And Facebook / social media allows them to enter some crazy moronic collective. Absolutely.

But the numbers of people are growing in a crazy way. A lot of us here had mostly normal neighbors or family members, who have just totally lost it. And I think what Ethan is worried about is basically the heart of the issue. *Nobody is in control of this thing anymore*.

I mean hell, Trump got booed at his own rally. A lot of Republicans in office tried to ride this thing like a toy (much like how a lot of the Trump admin didn't care too much about covid early on because it was ""hurting blue states"". Truly a genius move that pays off in the long run...). 

But now? This thing is spreading in the weirdest way. The damn Q guy (who is almost definitely a troll, obviously) has lost control, the politicians have. And I don't see much of a slowdown in it. When it gets taken down off social media, they think ""See! We're right!"", etc.

But it's more than just QAnon weirdos. The anti-vaxxers, and a good few other groups. This straight up feels like the start of a cult religion, and it might just.... stick around. That's the worry, I guess.

Ultimately, I'm just saying that Ethan is probably more right than a lot of people assume. This stuff isn't going to just magically go away overnight. If they band together and get religious exemptions and privileges... then we haven't see true crazy at all yet.

No leftovers this week, so felt like bringing up how valid Ethan might be here. Sorry for the random tangent!",2021-11-05 05:12:46,524

166,qw60l9,slowismore,Okay so apparently talking about the Titanic is also a qanon topic...,"I just brought up a random topic at family meeting about how horrible the Titanic disaster was (I was always fascinated by the topic and I used to tell them about interesting facts, new findings), and now I just brought up how terrible it was that there weren't enough lifeboats. And my dad completely went nuts. He started ranting about how the explosion (wth) was secretly conspired by the ruling elite to get rid of the unwanted other rich guys. Then how the torpedos were invented secretly before and they just shot the Titanic or something like that... And that of course I never heard about this because the mainstream media always lies to me and I am fed propaganda.

I was facepalming so hard and called him out about what if, for example, he didn't talk about nonsense like this all the time? (of course in a nicer way but I was fuming). He then went on rants about how he just wants to diversify my knowledge while simultinously telling me that everything tinfoil-hat-forum related is facts and everything I know is just lies and he questions the qanon lies too (!!!) but somehow always keeps preaching qanon (lies) because it's true (???) and he combined his own unique theory of this (based on qanon lies and false info).

What makes me generally sad about him is that he forgets everything (sometimes daily tasks), he always says it's because of his age, which could be true, but he somehow always remembers qanon propaganda while he forgets anything we ask from him or tell him. Same thing with the Titanic. So I asked him how come he remembers this conspiracy stuff about Titanic but can't remember literally anything I ever told him about the Titanic disaster, and I gave him an example and he was like ""yeah I don't remember this"". And he said it's because it doesn't change the fact why it sunk, what matters is who is behind it and that in reality it was all just a conspiracy explosion that sunk it. And this is the new info I need to think about.

I asked if he expects me to be open minden about qanon then why isn't he open minded about anything I tell him? He told me he is an open minden person then bounced off into telling me about how vaccines kill everyone and everything is a lie that the mainstream media tells me so then only thing he is open to is random lunatics who tell the truth on the internet, because it makes perfect sense, and even if it's not true it's still more true than anything mainstream science or media ever says since they just lie all the time.

I told him he keeps contradicting himself and avoids my questions then he continued the rants nonstop. Finally we ""joked it off"" and acted like everything was okay, but I'm still hurt and not okay at all, he seems to be very happy about himself though. He survived covid, he could have a good family life with us but he just keeps wasting it with lunatism and bitter paranoia.

On a side note my mom is defending surprisingly frequently my father's qanon propaganda so I'm pretty sure he has a negative effect on my mom too.",2021-11-17 12:46:20,250
167,qoyvqg,Ender8887,How I Fell into Qanon – The End of the Road,"**How I Fell into Qanon – The End of the Road**

It is not my intention here to explain what Q is or the history of the movement. This is more an analysis of one person’s psychological priming and making them susceptible to the alternative narrative Q offered. My motivation for writing this is primarily a selfish one as putting the process in words helps me to understand it better and I hope will allow closure for a chaotic chapter of my life. I am not trained in psychology but as I explain my story, I think you will clearly see the patterns emerge.

I became aware of Q in early 2020 just as the Covid pandemic was starting to affect us in the UK. The dramatic societal upheaval and borderline-apocalyptic outlook held by the majority of people I followed online fueled long seated paranoid beliefs within me. I had been into conspiracy theory since I was a teenager and until very recently held unshakable beliefs surrounding certain events like 9/11. I will explain later in the text what my views of these beliefs are now.

It is my opinion that Q arrived during the perfect storm. With global societal unrest and distrust in ‘officialdom’ reaching all time highs Q was already gaining sizable traction before the pandemic even began. Once the pandemic prompted lock-downs around the globe suddenly millions of people were at home with only the internet and traditional media to provide answers and a sense of social inclusion. With governments seemingly unable to provide satisfactory answers people turned to alternative sources of information to address their concerns. People wanted answers immediately, and there were people willing to provide them.

**Backstory**

I was raised a Jehovah’s Witness. This is a religion which follows quite a literal interpretation of the bible and as such is known for such practices as not celebrating Christmas or birthdays and more concerning is their practice of denying blood transfusions. To me however the most damaging aspect of the Jehovah’s Witness lifestyle is the psycho-social manipulation that takes place. I was taught from a very young age that we were not to socialise with children from outside the religion. We were not allowed to sit in school assemblies which took place every morning as they sang hymns and of course were not allowed to go to birthday parties. This level of social isolation from such a young age created a sense of loneliness and despair which still haunts me to this day. I am 34 now and still suffer a great deal in my ability to forge and maintain relationships but I shall address my current state later on.

The Jehovah’s Witnesses is not a religion where you can just show up on the odd Sunday like in mainstream Christianity. Once you become accepted within the congregation it feels like you are in some sort of club. Those families or individuals which did not zealously engage with the curriculum were socially outcast in a subtle but very damaging way. Words would be exchanged between members and people would associate with them less as it would affect their own standing within the congregation were they seen to be spending time with people who appeared to be less than enthusiastic or ‘falling away’ – a term I heard often for people who had slowly drifted away from the religion.

However, the most insidious tool used by the religion was ‘disfellowshipping’. This is an act whereby a person is ostracised from the religion due to committing acts forbidden by God and has not expressed appropriate levels of remorse. The disfellowshipped person is no longer allowed to attend meetings unannounced or to associate with any friends or family still within the religion. I witnessed numerous people being disfellowshipped throughout my years in the Jehovah’s Witnesses amongst them both of my older sisters. The damage caused by being cut-off by both friends and family is psychologically and often materially devastating. Parents have abandoned children, long time marriages have suddenly been torn apart and friends will turn their backs without a second thought. Many times these people are kicked out of family homes leaving them poor and homeless.

Anybody well versed in the history of cults will easily see the tell-tale signs here. It was only when I was much older I began to fully understand the scope and damage this religion/cult has caused.

Luckily for me I did manage to have some friends at schools throughout the years though due to my conditioning this instilled a great deal of guilt within me. My life began to split between the Jehovah's Witness aspect of my personality which was rigid and under strict rules, and the other personality which was associating with dangerous people at and outside of school. I would have to give a talk one evening at a congregation meeting on some bible story and the next day I’d be riding stolen motorbikes, smoking and drinking. My life was being cleaved in two as the rigid and old-fashioned ways of the Jehovah’s Witnesses could not contain all that I was. I did not understand any of this was happening as I was too young to comprehend, it was simply a natural process my mind was taking to alleviate the pressure caused by being so repressed. I kept all of this from my parents as I was too ashamed to tell them what was really happening to me. The guilt instilled in me by the religion is the most destructive element of this story as it stopped me from seeking help or confiding in anyone responsible.

My behaviour became increasingly dangerous and erratic and by the time I was 14 I was cutting myself daily and suffering persistent anxiety and panic attacks.  The few friends I had at that point were themselves very troubled. I was no longer attending school and spent most of my days wandering the fields behind my house, meeting up with other people skipping school or older people on my estate some more than twice my age, or (as was most often the case) wandering the fields alone afraid to go anywhere populated in case I was noticed and brought home or to school. I officially dropped out of school at age 15 after my parents received multiple threats from the school. They tried multiple methods to get me going back but I was terrified of everyone and the normality of the environment was not something I could cope with in my fractured mind. I had no motivation or desire to learn anything. At this point I was consumed by despair.

My parents separated when I was 15 and I was left with my father. My dad had his own psychological issues which caused him to be entirely self-centered and rarely paid me or my siblings any attention. Many times, he had left us in a state of financial ruin to buy things for himself even though often my mother was the only one working. He provided little more than a bare mattress on the floor and a roof. The rest of the time I was out with friends causing trouble and falling further into mental chaos.

There is another element I wish to add, which is that I was also sexually abused by a family member from a young age and into my teenage years. Again, due to the shame, guilt and the common misconception among victims that they are somehow responsible I failed to alert anyone to the problem. There is a no sex before marriage policy within the Jehovah’s Witnesses which also added to the deep levels of guilt I was experiencing. I wish to dwell on this aspect no longer as the effects of child abuse are well known. Suffice it to say, the damage was significant and lasting and only served to compound the sense of disassociation.

It was during these years I made friends with a boy from school who lived nearby. His family was relatively stable and his parents let him do things I wasn’t allowed to like playing violent or supernatural themed video games and watching whatever movies we pleased. Some of my happiest memories (actually to be honest they are my happiest memories) are of sitting in his room playing PlayStation games and listening to Eminem whilst eating junk food. The sense of normality and just being able to be a kid was incredibly cathartic and I formed a close bond with him. I realise now I never wanted to be a bad kid. I just wanted a home. I think without the grounding effect my friend’s hospitality had on me I probably wouldn’t be here to write this.

It was this friend that introduced me to conspiracy theories. We used to watch Alex Jones every time I’d come over. He had such an intense and passionate persona (though nothing compared to now) that it was hard not to be impressed. For a young and disillusioned boy such as myself it was easy to win me over. I began to fervently believe everything I was told; 9/11 was an inside job, Nazis are on the moon, chem-trails etc. And over the years these beliefs only became stronger. I believe the troubled upbringing I’d had up to that point and my growing distaste for authority primed me for the message being preached.

The following years were incredibly tumultuous. I was shuffled between my parents often being kicked out for stealing or being aggressive. Needless to say, I didn’t get my GCSE’s. I finally left the religion for good around 18. During this time from around 16 to 20 I was frequently having psychotic episodes where I believed demons were in my house or had possessed me. I could not hold a job at all due to the severe anxiety and other psychological processes I was experiencing. The most I managed was holding a job at Tesco for about a year or so but I was fired due to stealing. I ended up homeless after that and spent a few months in a YMCA and living at random peoples houses and flats. This was incredibly difficult for me as I had developed intense agoraphobia sometimes not leaving my room for days and if possible, weeks or months at a time.

It is hard to remember things in order as it is all a jumble in my head but at some point in my late teens I had a severe psychotic break and truly believed I was possessed. I had taken some powder one night (can’t remember what) smoked weed and had been drinking. All of a sudden, I felt a rush of energy through my body and my hands shot in the air. I was completely terrified. I just remember muttering nonsense for hours with my hands above my head and seeing a strange lady staring at me. The next day I was still suffering panic attacks one after the other and I was taken to A&E though there was nothing they could do as they didn’t know what drugs I had taken. I know now it wasn’t really the drugs. They just allowed the fractured part of my mind to come through. At the time though I believed things like possession were possible and I became fraught with anxiety. I would only sleep downstairs and I was hearing scratches in the walls, seeing faces in the mirror and other phenomenon.

Through a turn of events, I eventually ended up working in a bar which introduced me to alcohol and drugs. For several years I drank copious amounts and took any drugs on offer to dull my feelings. I even ended up living above the bar in a mould infested attic room with a window that wouldn’t close and church right outside which rang loud bells on the hour. During those years I saw a lot of violence and tragedy due to drugs and alcohol. Many of the people I knew back then have died due to suicide, overdoses or violent crime. It was an awful time but the numbing effect of alcohol and narcotics let me live through and occasionally even have fun. Throughout this time, I associated with other people who were ‘anti-establishment’ and believed in many of the same things I did though often not to the same extremes as me.

As the years passed, I began to develop a sense that I was on some important mission. No doubt lingering conditioning from the Jehovah’s Witnesses as we are taught exactly that. Occasionally I’d believe I could see things like demons following people around, or that I could receive messages from spirits. I believed that I had access to parts of people’s minds they were not aware of and at one point even told someone I was a God.

It is probably very clear to see the downward trend my psyche is taking from unhealed trauma into delusion but for me it felt like my insides were attacking me. My mind felt like a million shards from a broken mirror all presenting me with an alternative view of reality. My emotions were always to one extreme or the other. I was constantly on the edge of panic or a complete nervous breakdown. There was a constant drive within to be aware, and the persistent feeling that I was in danger and the world is a predatory place. Everyday I would conceal all of this and try not to let the cracks show. I was in complete despair with no one I could trust and I always believed there was only one ending for me. It was just a matter of time.

By my late twenties I had distanced myself from most of the people I knew from the local nightlife and moved out of the bar. I was drinking much less though not through any real choice but because once the hangover kicked in, I would experience suicidal depression. I would smoke weed occasionally with my partner at the time but even that had to stop as it no longer calmed me down, instead it had completely the opposite effect. I had been in several dysfunctional relationships but this was the worst. I was a traumatised wreck and my partner was suffering with bi-polar disorder. She would be completely fine one moment and the next she would be shouting and throwing things at me. We lived in a tiny run-down flat that wasn’t big enough for the two of us especially with the problems we had. Eventually it all became too much and I could no longer cope. I accepted I needed help and rang my mum to tell her what was going on.

Over the next few years, I managed to sort myself out to some degree. I moved in with my sister for a few months whilst getting a job at a local call centre. She lived in a nice area in Chester and the cleaner, less dangerous environment managed to relieve me of a lot of anxiety. I got myself a flat without really knowing what I was doing. I couldn’t afford it with what I was earning and ended up accumulating over £15k in credit card debt over the next few years. It wasn’t all spent on the flat however. I was trying to bury my old self by adopting a new, more lavish lifestyle. Even though I was still suffering and had not truly addressed any of my issues I managed to stick that job for a few years, even being promoted to work in accounts. However, it was not to last.

My anxiety and other problems never went away. It was just easier to hide them as I wasn’t in an environment that triggered me so often. In my time there I had more absences than anyone else and in my final year I’d had 12 separate absence periods. I couldn’t cope. What I was trying to keep hidden was constantly bubbling over the edge and I knew I couldn’t go on like this. One day I just didn’t turn up.

Luckily my other sister had invited me to live with her whilst I sorted myself out so I wouldn’t end up homeless again. However, she had her own problems with alcoholism stemming from much the same experiences as mine. I started an online course in IT so I would have a little finance to live on and hopefully at the end of the course be able to work for myself as it seemed the only way. That was in late 2019.

**Enter Q**

I could in no way fully put across the mental torment I have been through nor the vast experiences I have accumulated up until now (much of the worst I have omitted) but I hope what I have written so far paints a vivid enough picture to explain what comes next.

I heard about the encroaching virus through family late 2019 but thought nothing of it. I never watched the news so I just assumed people were panicking as usual. But as the story didn’t seem to go away, I started to pay more attention. The scenes from China of people collapsing in the street were insane and when our government started talking about lock-downs the conspiracy theorist in me found his calling.

It fit all the calling cards we’d been taught to expect; lock-downs, police state, surveillance/tracking, forced vaccinations etc. These were signs for what I believed to be the Orwellian state coming into reality. Overnight interest in the IT course I was taking vanished. I was completely focused on any and all news surrounding the pandemic. I scoured conspiracy boards, revisited old sites and watch countless videos on YouTube. It felt like all my beliefs had been vindicated. All these thoughts and beliefs I’d held that made me feel so apart from society were soon to be proved true. There wasn’t a doubt in my mind.

At first Q only sat in my periphery. I mainly settled on old favourites like David Icke for information but I became increasingly obsessed with a number of channels which were gaining traction on YouTube. Although I believed David’s message, I found him to inspire fear and dread offering little in the way of hope. I had mellowed out over the years and sought peace and serenity due to my nervous disposition. I began opening the floodgates to my more spiritual side to compensate for the fear this was causing within me.

It was during these forays into the spiritual side of media I began to hear the term ‘The Great Awakening’ being repeated. You see, many of these spiritual ‘influencers’ and indeed in the community at large, believe we are on the cusp of an awakening. An awakening which will expand the consciousness of the human race essentially elevating us to a new dimension of awareness (often referred to as 5D). Most of these spiritual influencers speak of the involvement of numerous alien races who were called here to assist with the enlightenment of humanity. My mind by this point was fully open and all critical faculty suspended. I began to believe everything I was reading and was practicing meditation to contact the Galactic Federation and all kinds of crazy stuff. I even believed I was successful on some occasions.

After some time, I decided to create a Twitter account and begin posting about my spiritual awakening and experiences. Posting messages on guidance to ‘transcend the ego’, ‘contact your higher self’ and other such enticing subjects. Some of my posts were really out there detailing astral travel through ‘sun portals’ and visiting alien ships but I didn’t care how it was received I was going all in. Almost all the responses I had were positive and people found my messages uplifting. I even started making long form videos on YouTube about spiritual topics. I see now that in times of stress people will search for positive messages as well as sources which will affirm their negative beliefs. The more stress you put people under the further they will go, the more they will suspend critical thinking to find a coherent theory to explain their experiences.

With more followers came more private messages and information in my feed. I started noticing a lot of posts mentioning Q and the hashtag WWG1WGA which stands for ‘Where We Go One We Go All’ which was a sort of motto for the movement. My curiosity piqued I began doing more research on Q. I liked what I found. Much of the information Q posted dovetailed with my own beliefs; that the world is governed by a shadowy cabal with no oversight or accountability, at the highest levels of power horrendous acts are carried out on an industrial scale behind closed doors involving children, most people in any position of power or influence are members of Satanic cults designed to compromise them and keep them in line. But the real hook for me was the idea of a Great Awakening. Yes, the term had hopped genres from the spiritual to the conspiratorial. In Q’s posts there is mentioned the ‘Great Awakening’ and is detailed much in the same vein as the prophesised spiritual event by the same name.

The Great Awakening according to Q, would involve declassification of almost all classified documentation where we could expect to find details of government funded and operated human trafficking and sacrifice as part of their Satanic rites, details of how the media has been used to hide crimes of the elite and to oppress the masses and virtually every other conspiracy under the sun. Those that were involved would be held accountable bringing forth a great cleansing of the ruling elite class and other influential entities such as Hollywood. Trump was also an intrinsic part of this plan frequently referenced by Q and made to appear as some kind of saviour figure. Support for Trump and Q go hand in hand. Trump’s actions further encouraged this belief with his sweeping changes to regulations, international trade and peace agreements, his actions against human trafficking and most of all his frequent mentions of the ‘Deep State’ which really became synonymous with the Illuminati, New World Order and other such phrases to describe the shadowy cabal believed to rule the world. It was truly believed by followers of Q that Trump was secretly working alongside Q which was basically saying everything Trump wanted to say but couldn’t. It's believed Q is a small unit of high-level military intelligence insiders answering directly to Trump tasked with executing ‘The Plan’ and cryptically informing the public through message boards such as 4Chan and later 8Kun.

I have probably not described it accurately and Q followers will immediately pick out all the flaws in my description and lack of accuracy but… I don’t care. It is ridiculous in hindsight and doesn’t deserve full explanation besides a full post-mortem examination for documentation’s sake alone. I’ve had nothing to do with Q or any other conspiracy for almost a year now so it is getting a little hazy.

Anyway, back to my story. I became obsessed with all things Q and found a thriving community of loyalists. I felt right at home. Q’s followers spanned the entire spectrum from American housewives to Japanese school teachers, from angry teenagers to the elderly and everything in-between. The community consisted of spiritualists and representatives of every conspiracy you could imagine. Everybody had a voice. It made people feel powerful.

You see Q was really just the stick and carrot leading everyone along. Q’s posts were so cryptic you could read virtually anything into them. They left a lot of room for interpretation and as such Q transcended its original form as just another insider on an anonymous internet board and became the embodiment of hope and empowerment for all that followed. The movement became an inclusive amalgam of all alternative narrative that conveniently all seemed to fit together like a giant puzzle. There were even maps made showing how all the different conspiracies linked to each other ranging from JFK to the Secret Space Program.

I began incorporating more and more Q themed posts into my Twitter feed interspersed with my usual spiritual posts and drawing the conclusion, as had many others, that Q was essentially the driving force for the awakening on earth and would be the trigger for the much grander spiritual awakening. My posts started gaining more and more traction until I was being reposted by other big Qanon accounts on Twitter. My follower count started to blow up and in the space of a couple months I’d gone from a couple thousand followers to over twenty thousand. I felt surer than ever that this was it. Although I did not care if my writings were well received it served as a sign to me that I was on the right track. No one had taken notice of anything I had done or said before. Now thousands of people were reading and sharing my thoughts.

The following months throughout 2020 was a social media frenzy. When I wasn’t on Twitter posting my own thoughts, commenting, recording or responding to private messages I was watching YouTube videos back-to-back. Many content creators focusing on Q and surrounding conspiracies gained massive followings in the months following the start of the pandemic. It is sad to look back and see how people’s fear was used to fuel the career of content creators. Of course, back then I didn’t see it that way. We were spreading the truth!

Later in the year the social media sites began cracking down on all accounts providing misinformation which led to massive purges on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube etc. Many of my followers were removed and I was capped at 16K with most of my posts having limited reach due to shadow-banning. At first, I took it as a badge of pride, that we were getting under the skin of the machine. Traction in the movement didn’t skip a beat as all the big names began migrating to alternative sites with less content moderation or in some cases even their own sites. I created a Gab account but by that point I was exhausted. I had effectively been glued to my computer for a year writing and searching non-stop. I decided that if my Twitter account was banned, as had so many others been, then I would quit posting. I felt I had done my part.

As I started to take more of a backseat however, I started to feel a niggling sensation at the back of my mind. I had been so frantic over the last year I had never really stopped to clearly think about what was happening. I started noticing how zealous and self-righteous the movement had become. People treated Q’s posts with a reverence you would expect of a vicar reading scripture. There was a heavy Christian element to the movement which I tried to ignore but looking back it makes sense being a predominantly American far-right movement. Due to my experiences growing up there was no chance I was getting involved in anything remotely religious. Well, not consciously.

As the months wore on and the Presidential Election grew closer tensions grew to boiling point. Followers of Q were absolutely convinced Trump was going to win and the round-up of the corrupt elite would begin. But by this point my doubts were starting to tip the scale towards reason. I still watched the election process and held on to the hope that what Q said was true but on the day of Biden’s inauguration I realised the cavalry wasn’t going to ride in and save the day. I’d deleted my Twitter a month or so before having grown tired of reading the same things over and over and all the in-fighting that was going on as the inauguration drew closer. Once Biden was made President that last little wisp of delusional hope dissipated. Although many still follow Q to this day, even though there hasn’t been a post since December 2020, I deleted all my social media accounts and removed all my YouTube videos.

It felt as though I had suddenly awoken from a nightmare. I had fallen down such an extensive rabbit hole that I had neglected my real life, the one where I needed real help, for an entire year. I had allowed my paranoid delusions and fears to take control and allowed my mind to be led along by people who had even less connection to reality than I did. Worse still I had helped other people do the same.

It took many months for me to stop being triggered by things I was hearing and seeing. Although I had completely stopped watching or reading anything to do with Q or conspiracy theories in general, I was still finding myself reacting to hearing things about Trump or the pandemic or anything else related. I was conditioned. Radicalised I would say but not to the extreme many have reached.

**The Great Awakening**

What saved me was the realisation of parallels between what I was a part of and my experience of being in a cult growing up. My subconscious was screaming at me to see what was happening but I kept pushing it to the back of my mind too awestruck to have met so many like-minded people and to be listened to and respected for my viewpoint. But once I slowed down the truth would not be ignored any longer. I will write out what I consider to be parallels between Q and a cult.

1. **Cults generally have a revered leader**: Although Q has never been officially identified it is clear to see the reverence followers have towards this entity and the faith placed in everything said by it
2. **Prophecy**: Like all great cults/religions there is a central prophecy which grants people hope in service for their suffering. In Q’s place this was the Great Awakening.
3. **Socially exclusive/destructive**: Although I have stated that people from all walks of life followed Q, people have isolated themselves from non-believers in many cases. I have heard many instances where families have been destroyed due to this. Friends have fallen out and relationships ended. Q becomes all consuming and anyone who doesn’t have the same beliefs is one of ‘them’ (the sheep).
4. **Suspension of critical faculties**: Through peer pressure, fear and other psychological primers people begin accepting information at face value as long as it fits their belief system. Information that would have been laughed at months before is now received without any form of vetting. Information is used to support beliefs no matter its authenticity rather than vetting information to form perception/opinion.
5. **Righteous conviction/radicalisation:** People become so emboldened and steeped in their belief system that they fully identify with it. Leading to them to believe they are in some way chosen to carry out a mission on behalf of the leader/god or to bring in a promised future of some description.
6. **Black and white thinking:** Good and evil is a fundamental principle behind Q’s posts frequently referring to certain people or groups as ‘evil’. Anyone with a modicum of understanding regarding the human condition will know things cannot be defined so cleanly. There are no such things as good and evil. Nothing is so black and white. This is a way to solidify a group mentality and clearly define threats.

These criteria are purely based on personal experience being raised in a cult-like religion. In some ways being raised a Jehovah’s Witness afforded me the knowledge I needed to recognise dangerous situations later in life, although a little late in my case. Still the staggering similarities was shocking to me and really helped me to remove any lingering loyalty or belief placed in Q. I am now determined to treat all incoming information with reason and logic. This experience has taught me how deceitful the world and indeed our own minds can be.

**Fallout**

After Biden was inaugurated and we weren’t raptured into the fifth dimension I decided it was time to get serious help. I was sick of myself. Sick of what I’d become. I felt stupid and ashamed. 34 years and I had nothing to show for it. If anything, I’ve had a net negative effect on the world.

Being traumatised, alone and scared sets people up. It makes them naïve and vulnerable to groups like Qanon as anyone can join and feel they have a purpose. That feeling of having a place in the world is like a drug and can be very addictive especially when the alternative is reality.

Since Q my mum helped me to get my own place which has given me space to think for myself and finally begin processing my past. I applied to a free charity which provides counselling for adult survivors of child abuse and neglect but we talk about everything including Q. I’ve been diagnosed with Complex PTSD and Autism and am on a course of medication to help me deal with the immense readjustment I know is coming. Surprisingly the government is helping me with providing benefits as I am classed as disabled. My previous self would never have seen the government as helpful!

Overall, it is the counselling that helps the most. Being able to talk about all the things I’ve been through and seeing all the different knock-on affects has allowed me to see I am not stupid and not always accountable for my actions. I have been in survival mode most of my life, a terrible state mentally and had received no help with that side of things so it just grew worse over the years.

There is no one to blame. Like a giant pachinko machine some people just fall through all the gaps. That’s life. There is no reason. It just is.

Letting go of Q and all the attached beliefs was a huge relief in reality. I had built up such a terrifying and predatory version of reality in my head I was scared of everything and wary of anyone who didn’t see things my way. It is a terrible and lonely way to live and I feel for all the people still affected by this. I wish I had a quick fix I could give to people to help effected friends/family snap out of it but it doesn’t exist. If it did, organisations like the Jehovah’s Witnesses wouldn’t still exist. Time, patience and understanding are all there is. They have to come to their own conclusion.

In order to recover I have learnt to limit my world to what I can affect. I have started getting into photography and I’m helping a family member edit videos for YouTube. For the first time I am starting to feel free and although I despise Q and all cults, Q managed to soak up all my delusions so when it fell, so did they. In the end it was a cleansing experience. One final ultimate delusion.

Please excuse any grammatical errors or poor writing style I wrote this all in one sitting.

Thanks for reading

My Q Anon father has sucked my mother down a Q Anon rabbit hole. Now, she tells me that she wants to have an anti-vaxxer cousin and some anti-vaxxer friends of hers from high school over for Thanksgiving and wants them to meet my teenage son. Apparently they think he needs to be saved from his liberal parents.

I declined the invitation and told her that we already had plans. Then, in typical manipulative fashion, she said that she would cancel the party if we didn't come. I said that she could host or not host as she saw fit, but we still have other plans.

I did visit her this weekend with the children so she is not ""cut off"", but I do not think that we need to make any more effort than we are already making. I am really tired of unpacking passive aggressive mental mind games after each holiday dinner- this dynamic existed before they even knew what Q was. The idea that I have to subject my kids to this nonsense in order to be accepted is over.

This is all true, but much of the mental illness designation is apparent in her youtube channel (she went by 'The Indigo Mystic') that is still up, and sadly you can see the progression.  Her very first video from January 11th says nothing about her personal court issues, but is all about the secret child theft ring run by top Democrats - and that Trump was still president and would continue to be.   A later video is just 30 seconds of 'Fuck Joe Biden' outside a roadside stand.  Even in some of her last videos, she has now equated her own custody battle with the local court authorities to the child theft rings that are basis of so much of the Q myths.     


Would she have killed before Q?  I don't know.  She may have latched onto something else but its clear she was working thru this extreme right wing framing of Gods and Demons (literally claiming in this first video you can not be a Christian and not support Trump).

195,q6pw5q,goldbricker83,Qanon obsessed brother has even turned against a band we considered our favorite for the past 25-30 years...I don't know how else to reach out and focus on what unites us anymore. I've lost my family to Q and Trump.,"Just tried to reconnect with my qAnon obsessed brother to go see our favorite band in concert: Tool They're coming to Minnesota this spring. We've waited literally decades for the timing to work out to go see them... and we were always willing to spend a pretty penny to go see them. I spent around $600 to get us good tickets, didn't even ask if he was interested because I thought he'd be stoked and it would be something we could do together as we don't spend much time together anymore. We've talked about it so many times over the past 25 years or so. But the past 20 years have pushed us apart so much, especially with the latest political insanity. In the late 90s we'd jam out to Tool and definitely bands like Rage Against the Machine, not just because it was badass sounding music but the anti-police messages did resonate with us even as conservatives. I remember everyone being pretty open to questioning authority back then and there were no party lines on that.  But now he says Maynard James Keenan is too big of a liberal, he couldn't stand to give him any money, and couldn't stand to sit there and listen to what is likely going to be ""endless liberal trump derangement syndrome diatribes.""

I gradually became a lot less conservative as I went to college and saw other perspectives, and formed some opinions of my own. I'm definitely pretty far in to the left wing persuasion these days. He went down a different path, served in the ARMY for a few years, and then since I was gone he started running around with a new crowd that were all about collecting arsenals of assault rifles and hunting every animal under the sun. I don't mind the hunting so much, but don't really get needing to make sure he can mow down a crowd of people.  Gun control is certainly an issue I'm still not that liberal on, but for him that has been the single issue that has dragged him deeply into the Qanon Trump cult.

So far gone that he won't even go see our favorite band together.  I thought maybe music would be the one thing we could still connect on. But at this point, since he knows I'm liberal, he probably wouldn't even want to eat the same food with me it seems.  It makes me really sad and I really hope time heals this. I thought enough time had passed already, but clearly we need a lot more.  I'm off facebook, he's still on there being radicalized further and further, and he pulled my mom into it with him but she will at least still talk to me.  But I had to drop facebook and that's like the only way she'll communicate as she hates the phone. Thanks a lot Facebook, Trump, Qanon, and all the other dark forces that are working together to derange and radicalize regular people. They think college took me from them, but it was you took my family from me.

I guess I'll be going to see Tool in March with someone else.",2021-10-12 11:23:24,1257

198,qkfiqc,swaggyfaerie,qanon prevented me from going to college,"i am 18. last year, as a senior in high school, i was excited to apply to colleges. this excitement quickly went away as every time college was mentioned, my mom (who is the main q crazy in our house) would cuss and yell and talk about how i will never go to college because they hate white people and all they teach is false and blah blah blah. also, most colleges require students to be vaccinated, which i’m fine with, but she didn’t want me to be. 

fast forward to college acceptances, i get in to a few but she refuses to send me. she has crazy rants and screaming fits where she will tell me how terrible and stupid i am for believing “lies” and somehow ties this to faith, claiming i will go to hell for not standing by the truth. i was terrified of even bringing the subject up anymore, but still tried. it didn’t work and i didn’t go to college. 

now i work for my dad and live at home. life is fine, but i miss my friends and i just want to learn. college has been my dream and i am so, so lonely. i love my work but i know i need to move on next year, i’m trying to apply to colleges but i am so scared and it’s so daunting.


my mom didn’t want me to get the vaccine, but i did it behind her back bc i value public health and the ability to be out of the house. she genuinely tried to kick me out after the first shot. i got the next one so hopefully if i get into colleges or travel somewhere i can leave. 

my mom has told me the pope is a hologram, that hollywood is a pedo ring, that the government is trying to emasculate men so China’s military can take over easily, and so on. i cant even have a regular conversation with her anymore. she screams at me and if i disagree she accuses me of being a Satanist and takes away anything of mine she perceives to be sinful. i am so done with this situation.


i have so much more, this doesn’t even scratch the surface, but it is exhausting to recount all the pain she puts me through and honestly i try to forget. i just needed to rant bc she makes me feel crazy and stupid. she won’t even hang out with me to watch a movie or eat dinner or go out anymore without bringing up socialism and crazy conspiracies. i’m so tired.",2021-11-01 09:44:57,567

Fast forward to this year, and now Q has taken hold. Covid is no big deal, it's all to control us, the vaccine will kill us all in 6 months, and she won't wear a mask. How could she forget 
that she almost killed her friend? 
She insisted that the vaccine would kill everyone who got it after 6 months. I told her I've had it longer than that and she replied ""I got one of the placebos so not everybody dies."" 

Another crazy thing, is that before Q, she was always a leftist, who believed in medicine! But now, she legitimately believes that Biden is a lizard person who is enacting a new world order.
She believes he will throw her into a concentration camp because she refuses the vaccine. She thinks Bill Gates is going to kill her while she's asleep.
She thinks the government wants to force vaccinate everyone because they want to microchip us and kill most of us. When I ask her why they want to kill us all, including themselves, she has no response. 

She is about to be fired next month because she refuses the vaccine. I asked her what she plans on doing for rent and she told me she will live with her boyfriend who literally lives on the street and goes to the bathroom in a porta potty. Why is she dating this man? Because he's ""anti vaccine"" just like her, he sees the truth.

She's stocking up on Ivermectin and Zinc, and posting anti vaccine bull shit on social media, convincing her friends not to take it. She thinks moving her hands around her ""chakras"" will kill covid.

I'm at a loss. I am disgusted by her selfishness when she saw first hand how dangerous covid could be. And I am worried that she will empty her savings when she can't get a job anywhere. She lives in a dangerous area, so living on the street will likely get her killed.
Is there anything I can do, or should I just sit back and literally watch her essentially kill herself?",2021-11-03 23:37:21,335

234,q9bkax,libertanggo,Divorcing QAnon Wife,"It is going to be a long story, but I've been carrying it on the back of my mind for the past 7 years and I feel the need to share it. 

We are a family of 4 and used to be happy. Now we are rapidly disintegrating and it's very sad to see what is becoming left of our once happy, closely knit, family. 

My wife doesn't admit she is a QAnon. She calls is ""people who think"", ""people who seek"" or ""people who do research"". She is ridiculing me every time I'm bringing up this term. ""What do you think, I'm a part of a cult? I'm doing my own research! And there are millions of people who think the same. Millions!"", she often says. The fact that there are so many people in the world, who share her beliefs, is really empowering her. 

My wife and I immigrated from Russia in late 90s seeking for a better life in Canada. And indeed we've got one. Both working professionals, well travelled, have lived in 3 major Canadian cities coast to coast. Children born in Canada and now graduating from high school and university. Pets, house, mortgage. A typical middle class family on an upper edge of income tax bracket. Yes, we frequently complained about taxes (who doesn't?!), but overall we have got what we came to Canada for. 

Our departure from Russia wasn't smooth. I almost got drafted to a war in Chechnya. A war that I didn't intend to fight, since in my view, it's been triggered by oligarchs to boost an image of then little known Vladimir Putin, who was being groomed to become a successor of Boris Yeltsin, the first president of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union.This move was to ensure that all the riches, which the oligarchs have accumulated during Yeltsin's time, don't get taken away from them. Up to 200k civilians and 40k Russian military died in this war, with estimates varying widely depending which side you talk to. 

So my wife and I have practically ran away to Canada, when I started getting notices of a military draft and after ignoring them, finding that police was snooping around trying to see my whereabouts from my parents and neighbours. But we didn't come to Canada as refugees. It was just coincidental that we've got our Canadian visas, which we applied for 2 years ago, were ready right in time, when the perspectives of being drafted and die in a war have become a bit too realistic. 

My wife was always by my side during these times. Supporting and helping. She'd come out first from our apartment in Russia, to make sure no one was waiting for me outside. She was there for me, when I had to put my head on her knees, crying from the amount of pressure during my first job in Canada when I could only understand about 40% of whatever had been said to me, and  my head was exploding from translating in my mind back and forth, because my English wasn't good back then. I really loved and valued her as a partner and our relationships become sort of an icon for people around us. No one would ever think we'd divorce. We couldn't have thought of that either. 

It all started changing 7 years ago, in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea peninsula from Ukraine. A ""brilliant"" move by Putin, whose approval ratings started getting abysmal due to rapidly deteriorating economy. Influx of propaganda, that has followed to justify this move, had created a psychosis known in Russia as ""Crym Nash!"", which stands for ""Crimea is ours!"". A phrase that happy mob was yelling to each other in fits of imperial ecstasy.

This was the beginning of Russia truly embracing  Orwell's 1984. A plethora of state sponsored historians have been engaged in rewriting the history, justifying that annexation of Crimea wasn't a steal and a unilateral break of the Budapest Memorandum, a document signed by Russia, UK and USA guaranteeing  sovereignty of Ukraine's territory in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons. But rather it was a moment of historical justice, longly awaited ""return of a ship to its native harbour"", happily embraced by the entire population of Crimea. While it was true that many ethnic Russians in Crimea looked at Russia as ""a greener grass pasture"" and had welcomed the annexation, Crimean Tatars, who regarded as indigenous population of Crimea and who returned back to settle in the peninsula after the deportation and genocide in 1944 for the alleged collaboration with German Nazis, had opposed it and now they are being persecuted by Russians for their political stance, which is now turning into a full scale human rights crisis.  

Then it got worse. Since Crimea is a peninsula which is not connected to mainland Russia and largely dependent on Ukraine for crucial resources, such as water and electricity, Russia has attempted the annexation of the whole Eastern Ukraine. Albeit through proxies, not admitting its direct involvement, but at the end leaving no doubt who was behind a full scale war broken out in Eastern Ukraine, resulting in about 13,000 deaths, with a quarter of it civilian. The most loud case known in the West about this conflict is shutting down of Malaysian Boeing MH-17 over Ukraine territory controlled by pro-Russian guerrillas, from an advanced missile system ""Buk"", supplied by Russia. 

In order to justify this, Russian propaganda portrayed Ukraine as a country that has embraced fascism. Any WWII collaboration of Ukrainian anti-soviet nationalist movements with Germans have been blown out of proportions, leaving no doubt in the minds of majority of Russian population, that the entire Ukraine is marching and throwing hand forward in ""zieg heil"" as they've seen in movies, and totally deserves what is happening with it. 

One thing to understand is that for most of the Russians, their victory in WWII, which they call Great Patriotic War, mostly downplaying involvement of the rest of the anti-Hitler coalition, is the most sacred thing ever. And the word ""fascist"" acts as an immediate trigger to drop everything, stop complaining about deteriorating living conditions, associate yourself with the heroes of the Great Patriotic War and be ready to fight that war again. And propagandists know it too well. This is why Russia spares no money to organize lavish GPW-themed parades on May 9th in every major city, which more adequate Russians call ""pobedobesiye"" or ""victory rage"". It's not only remembrance of the fallen heroes as we do it in the West. The slogans are ""To Berlin!"", ""We can do it again!"" which are sometimes seen as comical when a group of war-themed bikers storm through the German capital with these posters, but considering the context, it's not funny at all. Raising anti-fascist propaganda into a state of national ideology, Russia has become a fascist state itself.

And then temptation to rewrite the whole history was just to sweet to pass by. The most terrible figures of Russian history, such as Ivan the Terrible and Stalin has been whitewashed in the recently published ""historical findings"". Ivan the Terrible became the greatest reformatory of its times, and Stalin became again a wise father-like figure, who has won The War and built the Soviet Union in all it's glory. The number of people that died in gulags is downplayed in this book to around 700k, and mostly explained as thieves and traitors who were in a way of this glorious industrialization and had it coming anyways. ""Of course there were terrible tragedies, but which countries didn't have them?"" - say readers of these books, mostly pleased with the recent historical discoveries, portraying their country, once again, as the greatest peace making force in the world and its leaders the most wise and just. By rewriting it's past, Russia is defining it's future. Who would think to replace Putin, who appears so witty, wise and father-like figure just like Stalin? The true opposition in Russia is scarce and mostly persecuted and more and more younger people start dreaming about return of the Soviet Union, which appears to them as some Atlantis:  a glorious industrialized unconquerable country they once had and now lost. And who is to blame? USA and theirs puppets, such as Ukraine, and liberals and democrats who destroyed this amazing country back in the 90s. 

I'm writing all that to give you a context that what you experience as QAnon in the West, has started in Russia much earlier. The blatant lies, the media hysteria, the undermining of the democratic values and liberal ideas, the polarization of society. The tools are the same and so is the goal. To destroy democratic principles, give power back to authoritarian leaders and turn the society into a cult worshiping mob. 

So back to my wife and how all of this affected my family. I was shocked back in 2014, when my wife had  supported annexation of Crimea. When protests broke out in Russia against the annexation and against Putin ceasing more and more power, she was against liberal opposition. We talked about it. I told her how dismayed I was, but she insisted that she is entitled to her opinion and we have agreed that we will stop talking about politics and try to preserve all the good we had. That was the first shake into the foundation of our relationships, but little I knew back then that it was a beginning of a very slippery slope. 

My wife has become a true history buff and had sponged all the recent historical discoveries made in Putin's Russia. All the memoirs of Gulag survivors became fantasies of 90s, sponsored by USSR enemies, who have conspired  to destroy it. 

It went further. She started questioning Holocaust, by reading some theories that Jews have overblown the numbers, which wasn't in fact 6 million, but quite more reasonable number, in order to found Israel. The idea was that gas chambers were in fact desinfection facilities and it's been confirmed by some alternative research, published by some author, who has been persecuted for speaking out, which of course just demonstrating that he was onto something. This was the first time I seriously brought up the subject of divorce, if she continues down this path. 

Then the idea was that maybe Nazi Germany wasn't as bad as it's been portrayed in the past history and  we've got books appearing in the house about Hitler and Goering. And my questions why is she interested in this, she's been dismissing as just a historical interest of this period and what were all these leaders like. But it got her to denial of the fairness of the Nuremberg process. So Stalin was great, and Hitler was not as bad as Jews and US with UK. 


Then I started noticing her with earphones and tablet all the time.  I didn't know which videos she was watching, but she started talking about pedophile rings, Hollywood stars drinking blood of children, and the Pizzagate. It started to affect our children as she was sitting with my daughter and she was explaining how some furniture company uses girls names in the product codes to sell real children through Amazon. My daughter was terrified and went along with believing that it actually was true. 

You probably all know from this point on the key milestones. Her obsession with Russian neo-history got naturally morphed into QAnon. 

 I didn't know about QAnon back then and thought all it was just a bunch of disconnected conspiracy theories until I watched BBC episode about it. Then it all got connected.

I spent two weeks in Russian QAnon channel on Telegram and found out that one of the most shared and cited videos were of the professor Igor Panarin, of whom my wife was also speaking very highly. She was really insisting that I would watch couple of his videos. In her mind he was a cute retired grandfather, who was explaining what was happening in the world politics. I scrolled through the titles of his literally thousands of videos, where he's been promoting Trump as the saviour of the world. It would be even cute to think that some retired prof would generate such an interest, until you look into his bio. He is a former KGB officer, and a psychology prof who made multiple publications on information warfare and how to apply it in geopolitics. When I confronted my wife with these revelations that she was just being brainwashed by a professional ""Russian Dr. Goebbels"", she just dismissed it as ultimate nonsense. In her eyes he was already retired and was just airing his private opinions.

Needless to say that Trump elections were hell. We've been approached with watching all the evidence of the election fraud. It was toxic and exhausting to argue against that and maintain sanity.

The final point of non-return for me was Jan 6th, when she told me in the morning that it was a special day for her and she asked me to take care of the morning routines in the house. I agreed, but I had no idea what was going on until my daughter told me what was going on in Washington DC. When I confronted my wife if she supported this, she proudly told me she'd be there in this crowd, if she was in the US. I told her that I had enough and that we are divorcing. This time for sure.

She didn't take it seriously at first. But I moved out into another room.  And it's been now 9 months of separation and finally she accepted that this time it is for real. Kids are supporting me as they've been confronting her for her beliefs as well and they are just as tired and can't believe what happened to the mom they once knew. She is an antivaxer, of course, and they are embarassed showing up with her in public when she openly refuses to wear a mask. We are all waiting for July when our son graduates from the high school and we can all move out. 

It's a long sad story, but I felt like I needed to share it as I was observing through my wife how what was happening in Russia later morphed into something that started happening in the world. I believe the source of QAnon roots from their and I know some journalists who are researching the subject. But I also believe that there is no leader now in what used to be called ""Free World "" that is able to confront this decease from global politics sense. It comes from state sponsored propaganda of a foreign country, infects minds of people around the world, and we are fighting this battle in our families, suffering casualties, breaking once strong relationships and watching more and more people die in the pandemic that ""doesn't exist"". And so far this proves to be the best warfare, may be just as professor Igor Panarin has intended it to be in his numerous publications.",2021-10-16 08:01:44,1453
