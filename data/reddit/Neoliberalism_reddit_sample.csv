[""Chile, once considered Latin America’s Finland, is in trouble""](https://old.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/qipg8t/chile_once_considered_latin_americas_finland_is/)

Context: In the wake of large scale protests in 2019-20, Chile is currently holding both a general election and a convention to create a new constitution to replace the current one, which was instituted under the rule of a certain fella named Augusto Pinochet, known for murdering thousands of dissidents during his period of dictatorial rule after deposing a democratically elected left-wing government in a coup d'etat. His government is also often credited with introducing neoliberalism to Chile - and well, this thread is in /r/neoliberal. You may be able to see the problem here by now.

13,qtsd41,vivoovix,September 2021 /r/neoliberal Demographic Survey Results,"Over budget and beyond schedule as usual, the demographics survey results are finally here!

# General Demographic Information

## Age

https://i.ibb.co/b25Khkj/Age.png

Age distribution has stayed roughly the same, with 73.5% of respondents coming in between 18 and 29, compared with 74.7% last time.

## Gender

https://i.ibb.co/X3CC4kX/Gender.png

The subreddit has gotten slightly more male since the last survey, with 92.1% of respondents selecting ""Man,"" as opposed to 90.3% in 2020. 3.7% (66 of 1782) of respondents reported being transgender.

## Sexuality

https://i.ibb.co/JnGVZzd/Sexuality.png

The most common sexuality is still heterosexuality at 74.2% of respondents, the same percentage as last survey.

## Race/Ethnicity

https://i.ibb.co/McgW9QY/Race-Ethnicity.png

Note that although 1811 people responded to the Race and Ethnicity question, the total will add up to more than that because respondents were allowed to select multiple options. 20.1% (367 of 1768) of respondents indicated that they consider themselves PoC, a small uptick from 19.9% last year.

## Country

https://i.ibb.co/3Wq4YvQ/Countries-fixed-2.png

The subreddit has gotten significantly less American in the past year, going from 73.6% to 66.5%. Note that to stop the graph from being too big, I put every country with only one or two respondents under the ""Other"" category.

## Religion

Note that past this point, I don't have the results from the previous survey, so I'll be comparing to the May 2020 one (two surveys ago).

https://i.ibb.co/68ktnYx/image.png

Irreligiosity is still the largest religious affiliation, with a very tiny decrease in the number of irreligous people. (67.8% to 66% irreligious).

## Relationship status

https://i.ibb.co/HDYqQp5/Relationship.png

67.3% of people reported being single or unpartnered, a marginal increase from 63.8% last time.

## Disability

1774 people reponded to the disability question, with 90.4% (1603) indicating that they were not disabled and 9.6% (171) indicating that they were.

## Citizenship/Immigration Status

https://i.ibb.co/MCT15gQ/image.png

This question is new this year, so there is no previous data to compare to, but the vast majority (87.3%) of the subreddit reported being natural-born citizens. Note again that the numbers may add up to more than 1804 because respondents were allowed to select multiple options. The one ""Other"" response is someone who indicated that they were an undocumented immigrant.

# Education, Employment, and Housing

## Education

https://i.ibb.co/3CRwvbf/Education.png

Most (57.9%) people have a bachelor's degree or higher, a slight decrease from 59.8% in the last survey.

## Employment Status

https://i.ibb.co/m0MWQrs/image.png

65.2% of the subreddit has some form of employment, a slight increase from 62.4% in the last survey.

I've decided to scrap the second question from the employment section since, looking back on it, I structured it very badly. Even excluding students and unemployed respondents, the question only received about 1000 responses, and the very broad ""white collar"" and ""blue collar"" categories meant that a lot of people used the ""other"" option.

## Area of Residence

https://i.ibb.co/db3Kt12/Area-Of-Residence.png

We've fallen just short of reaching majority-urban (49.9%), although this is a small increase from 45% in the last survey. The proportion of rural people has stayed mostly the same, with suburban decreasing slightly.

## Living Situation

https://i.ibb.co/kH8WWy1/Living-Situation.png

This is another question where the total numbers add up to more than the number of respondents. I'd like to reword this question slightly for the next survey, since I think the wording confused some people, who used the ""other"" field to indicate that they lived with a spouse and kids (I've put those people in the ""with significant other"" category). Also, I'd like to change ""with parents"" to better accommodate people who may live with non-parental family (eg grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc.)

# Politics

## News sources

https://i.ibb.co/4M36dqT/News-Sources.png

Another new addition to the survey. The New York Times (43.7%) seems to be this subreddit's favorite among the options, with The Economist (40%) coming in at a close second.

## Political Views

### Economic

https://i.ibb.co/6nVXq44/Econ-Views.png

The subreddit is still strongly center-left, with 55.7% of respondents indicating that they were left of center, compared with 56.3% in the last survey.

### Social

https://i.ibb.co/0fVMqj2/Social-Views.png

The subreddit is much further left on social issues, 87.6% of people being left of center, a slight decrease from 91.6% last survey. Note also that there are more center-left than left-wing people this year, whereas there were more left-wing people last year.

### General Political

https://i.ibb.co/b32sP0b/Political.png

The subreddit is strongly center-left in general, with 73.5% of respondents indicating that they were left of center, a slight decrease from 74.7% in the last survey.

## Supported Policies

https://i.ibb.co/qMK97w7/SupportedPolicies.png

The three most-supported policies are Free Trade (94.5%), a carbon tax (93.9%), and marriage equality (93.8%), while the three least-supported policies are banning civilian ownership of guns (21.7%), no corporate tax (26.6%), and hate speech laws (32.6%)

# Neoliberal Project

## Neoliberal Project Awareness

https://i.ibb.co/fprSTcg/NLAwareness.png

7.3% of people were unaware of anything related to the Neoliberal Project, with exponents magazine being the most obscure arm at only 20.5% awareness.

## Neoliberal Podcast

1794 people responded to the question about the Neoliberal Podcast, with 14.7% (263) of people reporting that they listen to it and 85.3% (1531) reporting that they do not.

## Discussion Thread

1772 people responded to the question about the Discussion Thread, with 65.6% (1162) reporting that they use it and 34.4% (610) reporting that they do not.

# Subreddit-Related

##Americentrism

1710 people responded to the question about Americentrism, with 47.1% (805) feeling that the subreddit is too Americentric and 52.9% (905) disagreeing.

## Submission Quality

1722 people responded to the question about submission quality, with 23.6% (406) of people feeling that the subreddit has too many low-quality submissions and 76.4% (1316) feeling otherwise.

## /r/all

1647 people responded to the question about staying off /r/all, with 75.3% (1240) of people saying that they think the subreddit is better off for staying off /r/all and 24.7% (407) of people disagreeing

## Moderation Policy

https://i.ibb.co/r3PR6P9/Strictness.png

Most people (69.6%) seem to think that moderation is neither too lax nor too strict, with a slight preference for too strict among everyone else.

## Moderator satisfaction

https://i.ibb.co/d6228qx/Mod-Satisfaction.png

Overall it seems like most people believe the mod team is doing a solidly above-average job, with 67.9% of people giving the team a rating of 4 or 5.

## Survey satisfaction

https://i.ibb.co/ZxP1yrK/Survey-Satisfaction.png

People were slightly more satisfied with the survey (71.4%) than with the mod team, which I will interpret as praise for me personally and an indictment of the rest of the team.

## 🐊

https://i.ibb.co/nn3ms4F/Alligators.png

Overall, the subreddit strongly favors 🐊 (87.8%), with a measly 12.2% choosing Howie Hawkins over 🐊.",2021-11-14 09:39:54,187

I challenged someone on the r/neoliberal sub for saying there were a lot of bigoted social conservatives on r/neoliberal. Someone wrote back, after having viewed my post history, and said  ""Guy posts in samharris and can't figure out where the 'cringe social conservatives' are, that tracks""

I wrote ""Sam Harris is a pro-choice, pro-LGBT atheist and he's a social conservative. I mean there are so cons on that sub of the 'restrict immigration' variety but they aren't the dominant voice.""

Some other guy: ""He's also a misogynist and an islamophobe and pushes 13/50 racist propaganda""

I wrote ""I've heard the Islamophobe nonsense a million times (there's nothing wrong with hating and fearing religion, including Islam but certainly going well beyond it as Sam does in his critique of Christianity, Judaism, and so on) but misgoynist...that's a new smear on him so congrats I guess.""

28,qxvret,CuckBartowski,We've heard from the neoliberals. We've heard from the conservatives. Now let me offer you a take on the Rittenhouse verdict from a progressive....,"Having seen the evidence, it's blatantly obvious that Rittenhouse, though clearly a nut in his own right, was simply defending himself.  Granted, he probably wouldn't have been attacked if he hadn't been carrying that stupid assault weapon around in the first place, but he was within his legal rights so self-defense does apply here.

It's also worth noting that, just prior to the shooting, Rittenhouse was being chased by an angry mob who were throwing rocks at him.  One person reportedly tried to bludgeon him with a large skateboard.

Here's an excerpt from Wikipedia:

> In the hours leading up to the shooting, Rittenhouse appeared in multiple videos taken by protesters and bystanders and was interviewed twice: first by a livestreamer at the car dealership where he and a number of other armed men had stationed themselves, second by McGinniss. Rittenhouse was seen talking with police officers, and offering medical aid to those who were injured.

> At 11:48 pm, Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum. Part of the first confrontation between Rittenhouse and Rosenbaum was witnessed by McGinniss to whom it seemed that **Rosenbaum and other protesters were moving toward Rittenhouse, who was trying to evade them; Rosenbaum tried to engage Rittenhouse who avoided this by sidestepping and running away.** Rittenhouse testified at trial that Rosenbaum had threatened to kill him. FBI infrared footage taken from an overhead airplane captured the shooting of Rosenbaum and the events immediately preceding it.

> The remainder of Rosenbaum's confrontation, and the following incidents with Huber and Grosskreutz, were recorded in cellphone footage from multiple angles, including the moments of the shooting. Video footage showed Rittenhouse being pursued across a parking lot by Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum threw a plastic bag containing socks, underwear, and deodorant at Rittenhouse.  **A bystander named Joshua Ziminski fired a shot into the air, and then Rittenhouse stopped running and turned towards the sound of the shot. Rittenhouse testified at trial that prior to being chased by Rosenbaum, he heard another man tell Rosenbaum to ""get him and kill him,"" but also knew that Rosenbaum was unarmed.  Rittenhouse testified that he aimed his gun at Rosenbaum to deter him from pursuing him further.**

...

> **Rittenhouse then ran down the street towards police vehicles. After hearing gunshots about a block away, a video journalist from The Washington Post observed Rittenhouse run past with his rifle followed by a few protesters in pursuit. According to the criminal complaint, at that point, protesters were heard on two different videos yelling ""Beat him up!,"" ""Hey he shot him!,"" and ""Get him! Get that dude!"".** One individual struck Rittenhouse from behind, knocking off his cap, shortly after which Rittenhouse tripped and fell to the ground. Others shouted ""What'd he do?,"" ""Just shot someone!,"" and ""Get his ass!"". One of the men in pursuit jump kicked Rittenhouse while he was still on the ground. Rittenhouse fired twice but missed the man.

> Next, according to court records and video footage, another protester, Anthony Huber, made contact with Rittenhouse's left shoulder with a skateboard as the pair struggled for control of the gun. As Huber was pulling on the rifle, Rittenhouse fired once, hitting Huber in the chest, perforating his heart and right lung, causing his rapid death.

> Gaige Grosskreutz testified that shortly before midnight he had heard gunshots to the south and observed Rittenhouse running in his direction on Sheridan Road. While filming the protest as a legal observer for the American Civil Liberties Union on a Facebook livestream, Grosskreutz said he ran alongside Rittenhouse and asked ""Hey, what are you doing?"" and ""You shoot somebody?""

> Grosskreutz testified he believed Rittenhouse was an active shooter. Grosskreutz had an expired concealed carry permit for a handgun and was carrying a Glock pistol. He approached Rittenhouse, who was on the ground, but stopped and put his hands up after Huber was shot. Grosskreutz then pointed his handgun and advanced on Rittenhouse, who shot Grosskreutz in the arm, severing most of his right biceps muscle.

> At least 16 gunshots from other sources were heard on video during the time that Rittenhouse was on the ground.

Based on this, frankly, it looks like the people who were shot in this case were the vigilantes here, not Rittenhouse.  **The people who were shot clearly instigated the confrontation and it's also clear that Rittenhouse made every attempt to flee without violence.**  It was only when someone else fired a gunshot that he stopped running and turned to defend himself.  **So he didn't even fire the first shot ffs!**

**If anything, this case exemplifies the need for better gun control policies, including reinstatement of the assault weapons ban.**  In this situation, you had people who *aren't* trained police officers responding to gunshots without knowing who's doing what.  They made what seemed to be a logical assumption at the time (given their lack of law enforcement training) and moved to assault him.

This would never have happened if those weapons hadn't been on the street in the first place, especially Rittenhouse's assault rifle.  It also shows that adding more guns makes people less safe in active shooter situations, not more.

But are the Democrats making that argument?  No.  Instead, they're trying to politicize the verdict and cite it as evidence of racial inequality in our justice system.  

I have a real problem with this.  Why?  Because racial inequality in our justice system is a very real problem and there are tons of examples of white people (police and otherwise) getting off for crimes that black people probably wouldn't.  **When you start citing cases like this, you undermine ALL of our credibility when we try to draw attention to cases where this actually is happening.**

In this case, it's obvious the verdict had nothing to do with race (especially considering that the people he shot were white ffs).  The jurors simply evaluated the evidence and came to the only reasonable verdict.  His skin color is simply not relevant here IMO.

What also bothers me is how some *attorneys* are going on TV to complain about the judge disallowing use of the word ""victim"".  This is standard practice in cases where the defendant is claiming self-defense and it's intended to avoid prejudicing the jury (it's also why we refer to the accused as ""defendant"" and not ""criminal"" or ""murderer"").  That said, I do find it odd that the judge didn't also bar use of the word ""looters"", as that, too, is prejudicial IMO.  That's what the media and its pundits should be criticizing.

Rittenhouse is clearly a right-wing gun nut.  But is he a murderer?  The evidence says no.  George Zimmerman is a racist fucking murderer.  Rittenhouse is just an idiot.  Not a murderer.  Not a hero.

The jury made the correct decision under the law.  This isn't even a close case, here.  But that's not stopping politicians from fundraising off of it.  You should see the emails already flooding my inbox....",2021-11-19 20:34:40,51

43,r0kwzr,labelleprovinceguy,Mayor Pete and the Future of Neoliberals in the Democratic Party,"Hey all,

Been thinking about this and curious to get your thoughts: I think it's quite obvious that, of a vast array of potential Biden successors, Pete is one of the most friendly to neoliberal ideas and would actually attempt to govern in a genuinely evidence-based manner. I don't think this is a controversial view on this sub!

However, two issues I'd like to get your thoughts on: black voters are at the core of the Democratic coalition and they are decisive in the primaries. Pete didn't eve run against a black candidate last time (apart from Harris' brief time in the race) and performed very poorly nonetheless. Of course, Biden did come in with a big advantage there. But there is a good chance that, whether in 2024 or more likely in 2028 (unlike the 'he will be too old' crowd I think Biden is running) he will face black candidates. To what extent do you think he is likely to increase his support among black voters? If he doesn't, he's not getting the nomination.

The second issue is the general. A lot has changed in this country but there's still considerable homophobia and it tends to exist on a spectrum. Few people are 100 percent homophobic anymore but many are maybe 20-30 percent homophobic, meaning they might like gay singers or actors or say it's good gay athletes come out but for them the idea of a gay president is weird. Obama had to deal with this but he also could count on massive black turnout to override the reservations of people who weren't full on David Duke but struggled with the idea of a black president. Do we have any evidence on how Pete being gay would play in the general? I worry it might matter more than we'd like to think.",2021-11-23 13:21:29,46

“Look, as journalists, we swore a solemn oath to deliver unbiased, partial news, and I intend to abide by that precisely as we use our platform to scrutinize the facts and then determine exactly how we can make the govt. look right—and indeed, if—we will storm into the PM's office, hoist the delighted Prime Minister aloft, and regale him with spirited rounds of ‘Jai Shree Ram,’” said Shekhar editor-in-chief of The Clint.

“Unlike some of my liberal colleagues, I understand my solemn role in this situation is to examine all the information at hand before passing judgment. Then, and only then, can we know whether it’s a reasonable course of action to deploy some form of Saffron lube while repeatedly stroking PM's privates. Until then, it would simply be irresponsible to comment on whether or not we will import some *fancy toys* from LA to celebrate the passing of new bills that lessen the freedoms of this country's citizens"".

48,r4bv9t,bkon3rdgen,"Is there ANY pragmatic reason to try and redefine the word ""neoliberal""?","**Setting the stage for those who don't know:** In response to the tide of radicalism that has swept the internet, there has been a growing movement of pragmatic, moderate liberalism. This community is the best example of that. However, much of this movement has decided to identify as ""neoliberal"", as seen by this sub's name. This is despite the fact that neoliberalism, as it is academically defined, is represented by Reaganism and Thatcherism, ideologies which involve far more privatization and austerity than what most online ""neoliberals"" espouse. At present, the majority of this sub is basically comprised of anti populist socdems, people who believe in most Nordic policies, coupled with free trade and open borders. This is far to the left of traditional neoliberalism.

So, why is this sub called r/neoliberal? Well, its half a joke and is half a remnant of a very different time. As I understand it, this sub used to be filled with neoliberals/classical liberals, but as online radicalism grew, anyone to the right of Chomsky and to the left of Trump started struggling to find a place to discuss politics in a productive and pragmatic way. Seeing the moderate nature of r/neoliberal, many sought refuge here despite being quite different from its titular ideology. Since this community is multiculturalism-pilled, they opened their borders to these migrants despite the cultural differences. The average r/neoliberal user became more and more left leaning as this migration continued, but the name stuck, since most non radicals have been called neoliberals by both the far left and far right. The term is almost used like a slur or a boogeyman by these groups, so calling the sub r/neoliberal was a cheeky way of owning the term. 

**The Problem:** As you can see, this is quite a long, confusing, and terminally online explanation for why this community is called what it is. I've repeated this same backstory in a variety of different ways to the numerous well-meaning leftists who see the name of this sub and immediately turn their heads in disgust. ""No, i swear they aren't just a bunch of working class-hating ghouls"", I plead. ""They actually have a lot of good faith discourse, read the effortposts, you'll learn about history and economics!"" You see, I think a lot of online radicals would be forced to seriously reconsider their views if they actually gave pragmatic liberal ideas a chance. I don't think radical ideologies are inherently incorrect, and I myself am further left than probably 90%+ of this sub, but in the online space, moderate communities are just objectively more well informed than radical ones. Many well meaning lefties would likely be stunned to realize that they don't know the first thing about fiscal/monetary policy or government or what have you. But the label ""neoliberal"" gives them an excuse to just completely dismiss it all. To make matters worse, there is a minority of people here who legitimately DO simp for Reagan and corporations at the expense of the working class. There are also an even larger minority of people here (*\*cough\**, NATO flairs, *\*cough\**) who have very very very hawkish foreign policy. Don't get it twisted, theres nothing wrong with the presence of these folks at all, I love the concept of a ""big tent"" and I enjoy dunking on them as much as the next socdem. But the problem is that many people see their takes, see the name ""neoliberal"", and have their bad impressions validated. 

This issue isnt just limited to this subreddit either. This Twitter [account](https://twitter.com/ne0liberal) is called Neoliberal and is one of the largest liberal accounts in Twitter politics, but they are firmly in the Buttigieg-Biden zone, which is far left of the likes of Reagan. On Twitter and all throughout social media there are many such people. I could bring up example but there are too many to count. It really seems like a movement to redefine neoliberalism. I already mentioned how this is an obstacle to growing the movement and deradicalizing people, but it also has the side effect of making people think theyre neoliberals when they really arent. I see some folks being reflexively amicable to center right people/ideas or reflexively opposed to left wing people/ideas despite being much closer to the latter than the former, because theyre conflating old school neoliberalism and new school neoliberalism. Part of what causes this is the fact that unfortunately, many socdems and progressives are afflicted with populism, and are therefore cringe. So then you get people criticizing the tactics of progressives for passing BBB, despite agreeing on the importance of BBB, or saying they don´t like progressive economic policy despite supporting virtually all of it besides wealth tax/rent control.

Also, people still call Reagan a neoliberal, so we arent changing the term as much as expanding it. But does a political label have any utility whatsoever if it encompasses both Reagan and Biden (who's agenda involves almost $7 trillion of social/infrastructure/climate spending)?

Ok this is becoming way longer than I intended so here is the conclusion:

**CONCLUSION:** Is there any benefit to labeling the growing online coalition of pragmatic liberals as ""neoliberals""? Is it a good idea to redefine this term instead of coming up with a new, less optically bad one? Is the new definition coherent?

Obviously my answer to all of the above questions is NO, but I'd like to hear yalls thoughts. And for anyone who agrees with me, it'd be cool if you would leave a suggestion in the comments for a better label. Personally I don't mind the term ""New Liberals"", although it is very similar to neoliberal (in fact, googling new liberal just brings up neoliberal, damn it). Maybe ""Modern Liberals"", ""Big Tent Liberals"", something like that? Tbh, the main unifying force here is opposition to the modern Republican Party, so the most accurate term would be ""Anti-Fascists"" but of course that label is occupied.",2021-11-28 13:13:38,17
49,r3j8wh,ShitpostCobalt,[SPOILERS] Anyone else surprised that Arcane - so far - is not a story with a vehement neoliberal bias?,"When Riot announced that they wanted to explore both sides of the story, I felt like we were going to get another story where the oppressed turn out to be worse than their oppressors. 

I'll take a page from League of Legends lore to explain what I mean: 

> Imagine you live in a monarchy that hates magic. Said kingdom persecutes magic wielders through literal witch hunts. You come from a family of poor social and economic standing, but still holds the kingdom's ideals to heart. 

> You discover you also have the ability to use magic, and your parents insist you turn yourself in to the proper authorities. The authorities make an exception for you, since you have the ability to detect magic. You join their ranks in order to enforce the kingdom's witch hunts.

> In your quest, you realize that the poor are the ones who suffer the most from this policy. Even the nobles who decry magic for its chaotic nature hide their own affliction, but are spared from this policy.

> All that comes to an end when you take pity on a small child, shielding her from the enforcers. Until her skin brushes with yours. The child's magic courses through your body, killing three people. 

> Although you were just a child who did not know the full extent of your abilities, you are sentenced to life in solitary confinement. 

> You eventually break out and amass a following by recruiting exiled mages. Your intent is clear: To destroy the kingdom and rebuild on its ashes. Free of persecution and its hypocrisy. No more kings, no more lords.

It sounds like a story that's sympathetic to someone who was dealt a bad hand in life, so what's the problem? 

The problem is that the comic book that follows his lore constantly makes an effort to portray him as a charismatic and selfish demagogue. The comic book even goes as far as [to compare him to Hannibal in its visuals.](https://i.imgur.com/qL2RfTs.png)

While the rulers of the kingdom are portrayed as flawed, but with good intentions. [The sympathy is placed onto the kingdom, not on the rebellion.](https://imgur.com/TVkQQPJ)

 Now back to Arcane: This might be my own personal bias talking here, but I feel like this story makes a strong case for Zaun. [You have what is essentially the ignored and worst aspect of Piltover, who have to rely on crime and crime syndicates to live.]
(https://streamable.com/zfakc7) 

[The polluted air is hard to breathe in, affecting quality of life. Even most of the water there is toxic waste.](https://streamable.com/u9j6xt) All the while, it is most likely the main source of cheap labor that is building Jayce's Hextech technology. 

While Hextech Gates and Hextech and in general may have opened up new jobs, it did nothing to change the QoL of the Zaunites. This may be why there are more people who end up in that homeless camp that Caitlyn encounters for the first time.[ It's probably no coincidence that when the situation is framed this way, there are more people who use and end up addicted to Shimmer. They have no control over their own life like the top siders.](https://streamable.com/4o4gd6)

[The aristocracy and the heads of the state benefit from the suffering of the other side if it means they indulge in their wealth and influence.](https://streamable.com/ytrm3j)

With all these examples being shown, it's no surprise why Jayce was so easy to influence once he turned into a councilor, and why he takes the path he does. He approached Zaun's issues with how his peers and family expected to, as that is the worldview that was instilled to him in his academy days. It is the Zaunites who don't do enough, and it is the Zaunites who are disrupting the peace. Ignoring other facets that contributed to an attempted uprising that also left Vi and Powder oprhaned.

[While he does eventually reach another conclusion, his knee jerk reaction was to protect the status quo through more violence.](https://streamable.com/opc1ot)

[One enforcer who was stubborn enough to investigate a conspiracy is more knowledgable on the issues of Zaun than the councilors. Even more so than Heimerdinger, since he seems to have done nothing substantial to help them.](https://streamable.com/s8may9) It took exile for him to realize that he never approached Zaun the right way.

* Marijuana convictions were wiped off the books and the smell of marijuana is no longer grounds for police searches


* Home growing is allowed, 12 plants per household

* Local City/town governments can't ban weed businesses (in Colorado for example, they can)

* The state will license ""cannabis consumption businesses"" that might resemble bars or Lounges (most of the states that have legalized don't allow these kinds of businesses)

* In the interest of equitable opportunity, the state will issue “micro-licenses” for a small fee for cultivation of up to 200 plants. Those businesses might come to resemble small craft breweries. This is to make sure local low income New Mexicans can enter the new marijuana market and to help prevent corporate marijuana monopolies


* Unlimited licenses. Most of the other legal states have a limited amount of licenses, which is a terrible idea, imagine if there were a limited amount of restaurant or barber shop licenses available.

YIMBYs view the housing crisis as a supply and demand issue and the only way to fix it is by increasing supply. NIMBYs like to paint themselves as anti-gentrification and anti-urban renewal. They see YIMBYs as people who want to build luxury development in minority and low-income communities to price them out. Some of them, however, take it to the extreme. I was talking to this NIMBY who was against a new multi-unit housing being build in a single family area, and their reasoning was it would cause displacement. The thing is this new multi-unit housing was being built in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in one of the wealthiest cities in America. The income in that neighborhood is over $200k. They said however that somehow this would displace the 10-15% of people who are minorities and possibly renters.

Are they in the right though. Do YIMBYs just want urban-renewal 2.0 and are NIMBYs just the anti-gentrification group like they point out.

I have tried to have legitimate dialogue with them, hoping to understand how they squared the circle; understand how and why they rationalized their identity fetish. I have learned that for the average Redditor it’s emotion with a twist of self hate (many are mayo and ham sammiches trying to distance themselves from the ‘bad’ whites) or revanchism and how they have no idea how they arrived at their thoughts or how to defend them with reason.

It’s shocking how incapable they are of answering questions head on, how they immediately get emotional, call you names, misinterpret what you say and then go through your post history and bring up irrelevant things you’ve said (and misinterpret them). I have even had blatant attempts to dox me: asking to get on a video call and asking for my email to send me money to go away.

I’m subscribed to several woke subs, mainly to lurk and see what weird misinterpretations they have and see idpol on the ground. That’s all over.

I’m not only not engaging with them anymore, I’m unsubscribing from all political and culture war subs, with the possible exception of r/stupidpol and a culture-war-less economics sub.

My current perspective is that there’s nothing we can realistically do to change the path society is on, and a whole bunch to lose if one of these weirdos successfully doxes you.

128,qfil2y,Jameso_n,Attacking Capitalism: Do Academics Misunderstand Neoliberalism?,"This short discussion prompt was created from one major source: Reading (primarily) anthropologists and ethnohistorians talk about the world. Specifically, it arose from this quote, from [*Dark anthropology and its others: Theory since the eighties* by Sherry B. Ortner](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.14318/hau6.1.004):

> The case in point for this article is the transformation of contemporary anthropology in relation to, among other things, the onset of the socio-economic-political order called “neoliberalism.” While I will define the term more specifically later in the article, I need to say a few words about it here. In the period under discussion—roughly from the mid-1980s to the mid-2010s—neoliberalism as a new and more brutal form of capitalism was expanding rapidly over the globe. On the domestic front, the American economy in the 1980s began what historian Robert Brenner (2006) has called “the long downturn,” culminating in the near crash of the stock market in 2008, followed by a deep recession. The banks had grown “too big to fail,” were bailed out after the crisis with taxpayers’ money, and promptly rewarded themselves with giant bonuses to their top executives. In addition, the gap between the rich and poor in America increased steadily during this period, eventually exceeding the gap in place before the Great Depression of the 1930s—and economists are increasingly pessimistic about reversing this trend (Piketty 2014). Meanwhile, on the international front, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank pursued neoliberal economic policies that essentially crushed the economies of some of the smaller and poorer nations of the world (Ferguson 1999; Duménil and Lévy 2004; Harvey 2005; Klein 2007; Ortner 2011).

And from the [Cambridge Encyclopedia of Anthropology](https://www.anthroencyclopedia.com/entry/neoliberalism):

> However, in the 1990s and early 2000s, neoliberalism came to replace ‘globalization’ as the most relevant ‘world system’ within which to understand a variety of ethnographic cases. This was not just a shift in terminology. Increasingly, anthropologists became pessimistic about the exclusionary effects of globalization and capitalism in their fieldsites around the world (Ortner 2011). Neoliberalism was the word used to critically spotlight these effects. Often, in doing so, these theorists made use of a variety of Marxist tools and concepts. Some of these anthropologists focused on neoliberalism as a policy project with material effects, especially the accumulation of wealth in the upper class. Others framed it as a culture, or set of ideological values and discourses.

> Geographer David Harvey is perhaps the most vocal proponent of a class-based theorisation of neoliberalism. For Harvey (2007, 2016), neoliberalism is a globally-dominant policy project designed to intensify the accumulation of wealth in the upper class. It is characterised primarily by ‘deregulation, privatization, and withdrawal of the state from many areas of social provision’ (Harvey 2007: 3). This policy project draws on a number of discourses and values, which echo those of significance to the neoliberal architects and engineers discussed above: for instance, the ‘assumption that individual freedoms are guaranteed by freedom of the market’ (Harvey 2007: 7). Yet at base, it is best understood as a practical political tool for wealth accumulation. As Harvey notes, the ‘increasing social inequality’ is observable in national income distribution. After neoliberal reform in the US, for instance, ‘the ratio of the median compensation of workers to the salaries of CEOs increased from just over 30 to 1 in 1970 to nearly 500 to 1 by 2000’ (Harvey 2007: 16).

134,pzrlcx,Sic1Semper1Tyrannis1,"Time to dispel the myth neoliberal lockdown fanatics AKA globalists are communists. They're not communists, they're FASCISTS","Neoliberal ""elites"" have no use for Karl Marx. Few have ever read Marx or have any understanding of his basic ideas. Concepts like surplus value or the materialist conception of history are entirely absent from the neoliberal vocabulary.

The accusation these neoliberals are ""cultural Marxists,"" sometimes tossed about by believers in the JQ, strikes me as a paranoid anti-Semitic trope. It's groundless because no such transformation of neoliberalism into ""cultural Marxism"" in neoliberal circles has ever been demonstrated.

The similarities between globalism and communism end once you get beyond the wealth and autocratic power of neoliberal ""elites"" and *nomenklatura*. What is more interesting are the similarities between globalists and fascists, which are much deeper and more pronounced. For one, globalists and fascists are capitalists. Globalists use outsourcing and mass immigration to ruthlessly exploit cheap third world labor, similar to the fascist exploitation of non-Aryan slave labor. (Incidentally, those who know anything about Marx know he would have condemned the neoliberal multicultural egalitarian justification of the capitalist exploitation of non-white labor as inescapably bourgeois.)

If the globalists were communists, you would see hygiene theater mandated through nationalized or state-owned industry, but you don't. Like fascists, who believe in the collaboration between government and business owners for the achievement of mutually beneficial aims in the management of economy and society, globalists advocate public-private partnership, such as of course the use of big business to mandate hygiene theater. This isn't really far off from the fascist corporatism advocated by Mussolini.

This raises the question of what exactly is the dominant ideological influence on neoliberalism. Briefly, this appears to be Rousseau, who believed in the almost unlimited capacity of man for perfectibility through educational and institutional reform. The modern liberal's fanatical and unwavering commitment to the achievement of complete equality of outcome between sexes and races, by radically restructuring society, is predicated on this Enlightenment idea.

Some people would contest my classification of globalism as fascism because superficially, neoliberals differ from fascists in their embrace of non-racialism and post-nationalism. To which I respond: neoliberal non-racialism (i.e. so-called ""multiculturalism"") is entirely cynical, masking a deep-seated racism toward non-whites. Under neoliberal regimes, non-whites are almost entirely concentrated in menial and other non-management positions, serving an ""elite"" class of neoliberal whites as cheap and easily disposable slave labor (notice how those at the very top are almost entirely white?). Neoliberal ""elitists"" share the same attitude the Nazis had toward their non-Aryan slave labor.

""Elite"" whites are said to be self-hating, but in reality, only despise whites they regard as social and economic inferiors, hence the latter's dispossession through affirmative action and mass non-white immigration. This isn't communist at all and is without parallel in Soviet ""multiculturalism."" The hatred the ""superior"" white has for the ""inferior"" is eugenic. In the German Nazi hierarchy, there were racially desirable and undesirable elements i.e. the communists, homosexuals, mentally defective etc. who were eventually purged. This isn't too much different from the neoliberal globalist hierarchy, which also has its racially desirable and undesirable elements i.e. basically any white that lacks the wealth, power, connections, even ideological commitments of racially desirable whites.

Globalists consider some rich and powerful non-whites honorary ""good"" whites, much like the Germans considered the Japanese ""honorary Aryans,"" so it's not surprising to see a few non-white faces in the upper echelons of neoliberal power.

It's true neoliberal ""elites"" are post-national in ideology, but this is only true as far as territories with fixed boundaries go. How globalists plan on implementing a system of global governance without some form of nation-state remains a mystery.

So globalists are not communists. Far from it. They're fascists or more accurately, neo-fascists.",2021-10-02 03:56:25,136

145,pvnwrg,TasteMyPoopsicle,"Why do neoliberals demand free markets for housing construction, but not free markets for healthcare providers?","/r/neoliberal will expound all day long the problems caused by government interference in the housing market, but then demand socialized healthcare at the same time.

Why?

Healthcare in America is already extremely regulated by government, and we can all see the cost: enormous healthcare prices which are largely caused by [much higher than average ""administration"" expenses](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200218.375060/full/) which have grown faster over the last 75 years (as government got involved in healthcare) than the cost of actual care itself.

Democrats love blaming health insurance companies because it resonates with voters who hate that their health insurance company charges them so much. But this blame is largely misplaced. The average health insurance company in America has a profit margin of [only 3%](https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/2019%20Health%20Industry%20Commentary_0.pdf). About 86% of the money you pay for health insurance goes straight to paying for actual healthcare services, which includes *administration* costs incurred by the medical facility being paid.

What are administration costs anyways? Largely they are the cost of compliance with enormous regulatory burden imposed by government. Complying with regulation not only requires hiring additional personnel to fill out paperwork, but also takes up time of doctors and nurses which would otherwise be spent treating more patients - thus increasing the supply of healthcare services and reducing prices.

It's worth noting that the 14% of health insurance premiums which fund the health insurance companies themselves are largely caused by government policy to begin with. Health insurance policies were much less popular before WW2 [when government accidentally incentivized](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/the-complete-history-of-employer-provided-health-insurance) companies to start offering health insurance instead of wage raises. Government has obviously not learned anything from this mistake, as the primary feature of Obamacare was the mandate that you *must* buy health insurance. Democratic members of Congress seemingly didn't realize that forcing everyone to pay for an additional layer of beaurocracy is going to increase total expenditures, not decrease them.

It's possible that in a world without government regulation of healthcare, most of the 14% chunk of premiums consumed by health insurance companies would disappear, as consumers would purchase healthcare directly from their doctor or hospital at more affordable prices. In the early 1900's, before government regulation of healthcare, this was the norm.

Supporters of socialized healthcare in America today prefer to ignore the blatantly obvious elephant in the country: US healthcare [already *used to be* affordable](http://freenation.org/a/f12l3.html) when it was run by free markets, but then government got involved. We *already had* affordable healthcare, but government has created so much regulatory burden over the last 75 years that now it has multiplied in price. Government not only restricts supply with all manner of regulations, but it also subsidizes demand by funding Medicare and Medicaid at the same time. What happens to price when you put restrictions on supply but use taxpayer dollars to fund demand? It goes up!

Free markets would drastically lower the cost of healthcare in America, benefitting everyone except for the currently overpaid healthcare administration industry, who would lose their jobs or have to be retrained for something else.

The final issue I will address is the ""moral"" issue. *Do free marketeers want poor people to die without healthcare?* Of course not! I may be a liberty-loving individual, but I am not a monster.

The simple fact is that if you allow healthcare providers to operate in a free market, supply of healthcare services will increase. When supply increases, prices will decrease. This means that the average poor person will be able to afford more healthcare services, and this also means that the current dollars spent on Medicaid, Medicare, and the VA will be able to purchase more healthcare for more people. Yes, you read that right: Free markets can be used to improve the outcomes of socialized healthcare. What an ironic twist.

Subsidizing demand for healthcare is *kind of alright* from an economic efficiency perspective, *if* the supply is able to grow freely to meet that higher demand. Our current supply is not allowed to grow freely, which is why costs have spiraled out of control.

Finally, I will respond to the ""should ambulances turn away poor people who are dying in the street?"" line of thinking. It's estimated that emergency healthcare, as in ""I need it right now, or I will die"" amounts to [only 2 to 10%](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2013/oct/28/nick-gillespie/does-emergency-care-account-just-2-percent-all-hea/) of total American healthcare spending, depending on how you define ""emergency"". The vast majority of healthcare spending is not so dramatic: you spend days, weeks, months, or years planning out your healthcare treatment with your doctor.

Government could easily continue [the existing mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Treatment_and_Active_Labor_Act) that hospitals must treat emergency patients regardless of ability to pay, while adding in a socialized funding mechanism that simply says: If you can prove you have a very low income, government will pay for your emergency healthcare treatments after-the-fact. This would prevent the poor from ""dying in the streets"" while also preventing the rich from abusing the system to get free healthcare. The costs of funding *just* emergency care and *just* for people who are too poor to afford it themselves would be far less than the costs we currently incur from having such an unfree market of healthcare providers.",2021-09-26 00:52:54,51

&#x200B;

For some reason the show has mass appeal world-wide, and the reason why is obvious:

**The entire Game is an allegory for Capitalism.**

It is promised that all of the games are fair and only the most qualified person can win. But in reality the most important factor for success in all the games is luck:

**Game 1** it's how much you can resist being startled.

**Game 2** it's what shape you pick.

**Game 3** it's basically a contest of strength.

**Game 4** most players decided to play ""even or odd"" which is a 50/50 split chance.

**Game 5** depends on whether or not you picked the back row.

**Game 6** it's basically how athletic/good at fighting you are.

&#x200B;

Sure there is some skills that apply to this that can be overcome. Such as Il-Nam's strategy for tug of war, but even that strategy almost failed and could easily just be replicated better by a stronger team. Winning the game's is mostly based on luck of the draw and how your genetics/background happen to play in certain situations.

And the people who run the games are the super rich themselves, who despite use the veneer that the games are based on ""fairness"" and ""a chance to get rich"", are in reality nothing more but to benefit them (in this case for entertainment).

In fact, the only person who seems to believe the game's philosophy so whole heartedly is the Frontman, most likely due to the fact that he won the game's originally himself, so ""if he can do it, anyone can!""

The game also touches upon that working within the system you are forced to cut throat of others in order to get ahead. Sang-woo is the perfect example of this with Ali and Saebeyeok (in a both literal and figurative sense).

Add elements such divided families with Gi-hun having a near estrange relationship with his daughter and immigration with Ali, and it relates even more to the modern world.

Today almost every major nation follows the doctrine of neoliberal capitalism, which focuses heavily on free trade, little regulation, privatization, and globalization.  The show puts that in full focus and since this is the same doctrine that the Japan, United States, Europe, and majority of the rest of the world follows, the show has massive crossover appeal.

&#x200B;

EDIT - Looks like I had it [on the money](https://variety.com/2021/global/asia/squid-game-director-hwang-dong-hyuk-korean-series-global-success-1235073355/):

&#x200B;

I think that the majority of you know about this kind of narrative because the usage of ""neoliberal"" as a curse word. But for the sake of clarity, I'm talking about that idea that the history of the post ww2 world can be summarized as:  
(Note: Skip all the parts with numbers if you don't read much)  
1. Keynes -- very cool dude BTW -- and his ideas had influeced all the world and created a universal concesus that every party that wanted to competitive followed  
2. The economic liberalism was dead, because no one believed in laisse faire capitalism anymore. So the Mont Pelerin Society organized as a group to create ideas and policies to use to overthrown keynesianism and revitalize liberalism, and their called these ideas and policies of ""NEOLIBERALISM"" MUHAHAHA  
3. So Friedman and the Chicago School professors of economics was the bastion of forming followers of the ideas of members of the Mont Pelerin Society. And when the Chicago Boys were sended to help Chile economics during Pinochet, they created the first neoliberal country that was endorsed by Friedman.  
4. The Stagflation in the Oil Crisis of 1970s together with the end of the Bretton Woods ended keynesianism era. So a bunch of entrepeners spounsed neoliberal thinkers to spread their info and substitute the keynesianism in academia.  
5. The neoliberals use Reagan and Thatcher to finally put their policies in developed countries. The conservatives agreed because the two groups hate welfare state. And with this neoliberal-conservative group, the Mont Pelerin finally achieve his goal MUHAHAH  
6. So the rest of the developed world become neoliberal also by the victory of the conservative parties that wanted to dismantle welfare. And the left wing parties of the developed world become ""center right"" neoliberals that are progressive liberal because their donors like neoliberalism very much now.  
7. IMF and World Bank became infested of neoliberals shitholes and spreaded neoliberalism in the developed countries for them achieve loans   
8. Now the world is real and inequality has increasead. Now social mobility is a myth and welfare state is breaking more and more. The poor are more exploited while the richest is richest. And our wages growth are staganted and every zoomer and millenial will have crap jobs. And neoliberalism is also the main drive for climate apocalypse, so because of all that, we need to destroy it.  


Well, this summary was bigger than I thought that would be. Anyway, I find various parts of this narrative bullshit, but are you thoughts about this narrative? What are the errors and things that are true in this narrative? Why do you think that so many places on the left believes in it?

180,qh2q9c,labelleprovinceguy,Neoliberalism and Wokeness,"So anytime the term 'wokeness' is mentioned on the sub we get the bot saying being woke is 'evidence based policy' and this is usually downvoted. I'm curious to get the sub's thoughts on 'wokeness' and its relationship to neoliberalism. As I see it there are two forms of wokeness: the first is simply a committed to being aware of and battling social injustices, especially those affecting historically subjugated minorities such as women, the LGBT community, blacks, immigrants, and so on. In this form, wokeness is really just a liberalism of individual rights with a particular concern for ensuring all individuals really do enjoy those rights. If this is wokeness, we should all be on board. Unfortunately this is not the most common form  wokeness takes. I've identified what I regard as some of its more common features below and they all strike me as deeply problematic and inimical to a substantively sound and politically viable neoliberal politics. Curious to hear your thoughts

1. The uses of terms and phrases by overwhelmingly white middle and upper-middle class people who absurdly think minorities like those terms. Latinx is the most obvious. 90 percent of the time I hear the term used it's by a white person or a racial minority that went to an elite school with a bunch of white people. The average Latino rolls their eyes when you say fucking Latinx.
2. The notion that gender that all differences between men and women, except the obvious anatomical ones, are socially constructed. Not some, not most, but all or virtually all. This is anti-science.
3. The comical claim that racism is 'prejudice plus power' so minorities cannot be racist. So a black janitor who thinks Jews 'run the world' is not racist because he has no power. Seems flawed...
4. Claiming in a discussion of gender or race that white men should shut up and listen. This is terribly at odds with the liberal value of impartial truth and makes immutable characteristics the basis for evaluating claims.
5. Treating minorities as a monolith by using phrases like 'voices of color' as if all non-white people think the same and then, when presented with numerous non-white individuals who reject the approved 'voice of color' perspective, accuse them of internalized racism or, if it's a woman, internalized sexism.
6. A refusal to take individual behavior and responsibility seriously and to look at how bad personal choices drive outcomes. For instance, in discussions of poverty, refusing to acknowledge that failing to graduate high school, having kids out of wedlock, and not working full time are all massive predictors of poverty. This is consistent with recognizing that black people who do all these things are still more likely to be in poverty than whites who do all three things because racism is real.
7. Missing the big picture: this is to say policing language rather than taking on big structural inequities. The greatest form of privilege in our world today is closed borders, yet national origin privilege is so rarely talked about and it's by far the most consequential form.",2021-10-27 13:08:02,21

However, during the late 20th century, many countries in East Asia adopted a different economic model, characterized by import substitution, export subsidization, state control of finance, and large-scale targeted investments in education and physical infrastructure. Japan, South Korea, Singapore, China and others all adopted this model and presided over some of the most dramatic expansions of wealth and reductions in extreme poverty in human history. Most of the reductions in global poverty in recent history that neoliberals talk about came from these decidedly non-neoliberal countries.

> East Asian countries saw rapid economic growth from the end of the Second World War to the East Asian financial crisis in 1997. For instance, percentage annual average growth between 1970-96 was 3-5% in China, Hongkong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.[5] Within this period developing of The East Asian countries were growing three times more than was the rate of growth of the world economy.[6] Hence those countries attract most of foreign and private capital inflows into those countries.[5] During this period east Asian countries also achieved dramatic reductions in poverty; the greatest example is Indonesia, where the percentage of people living below the official poverty line fell from 60% to 12% between 1970 and 1996. Further, Indonesia's population increased from 117 to 200 million. Equally impressive is the growth of real wages between 1980 and 1992, with average wages in newly industrialised Asian countries increasing at a rate of 5 percent a year, whereas at the same employment in manufacturing increased by 6 per cent a year. In conclusion the growth period in the East Asian countries saw a large improvement in the overall standards of living.[6]

> Some of the best prospects for economic growth in the last few decades have been found in East and Southeast Asia.[2] Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, and Indonesia are developing at high to moderate levels. Thailand, for example, has grown at double-digit rates most years since the early 1980s. China had been the world leader in economic growth from 2001 to 2015. It is estimated that it took England around 60 years to double its economy when the Industrial Revolution began. It took the United States around 50 years to double its economy during the American economic take-off in the late nineteenth century. Several East and Southeast Asian countries today have been doubling their economies every 10 years.[4]

> It is important to note that in most of these Asian countries, it is not just that the rich are getting richer, but the poor are becoming less poor. For example, poverty has dropped dramatically in Thailand. Research in the 1960s showed that 60 percent of the people in Thailand lived below a poverty level estimated with cost of basic necessities. By 2004, however, similar estimates showed that poverty there was around 13 to 15 percent. Thailand has been shown by some World Bank figures to have had the best record for reducing poverty per increase in GNP of any nation in the world.[5][6][7]

Japan had the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which effectively controlled their import/export policy, tariffs, and controlled investments through a national development bank far larger than any commercial bank in the country at the time. It was during this period where the ""Japanese Economic Miracle"" occurred:

> Between 1953 and 1965, GDP expanded by more than 9% per year, manufacturing and mining by 13%, construction by 11%, and infrastructure by 12%. In 1965 these sectors employed more than 41% of the labor force, whereas only 26% remained in agriculture.

> The mid-1960s ushered in a new type of industrial development as the economy opened itself to international competition in some industries and developed heavy and chemical manufactures. Whereas textiles and light manufactures maintained their profitability internationally, other products, such as automobiles, electronics, ships, and machine tools assumed new importance. The value added to manufacturing and mining grew at the rate of 17% per year between 1965 and 1970. Growth rates moderated to about 8% and evened out between the industrial and service sectors between 1970 and 1973, as retail trade, finance, real estate, information technology, and other service industries streamlined their operations.

South Korea nationalized the financial system, prohibited the entry of imports other than raw materials, and had the Japan-inspired Ministry of Trade and Industry alongside the Economic Planning Board, which ran ""Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plans"". It was during this period where the ""Miracle on the Han River"" occurred:

> From 1961 to 1979 child mortality declined by 59%[5], this was the second fastest decrease in child mortality of any country with over 10 million inhabitants during the same period.[6]

> According to the Gapminder Foundation Extreme poverty was reduced from 66.9 percent in 1961 to 11.2 percent in 1979, making this one of the fastest and largest reductions in poverty in human history.[4] 

> South Korea's real gross domestic product expanded by an average of more than 8 percent per year,[38] from US$2.7 billion in 1962[39] to US$230 billion in 1989,[40] breaking the trillion dollar mark in 2006. Nominal GDP per capita grew from $103.88 in 1962[41] to $5,438.24 in 1989,[42] reaching the $20,000 milestone in 2006. The manufacturing sector grew from 14.3 percent of the GNP in 1962 to 30.3 percent in 1987. Commodity trade volume rose from US$480 million in 1962 to a projected US$127.9 billion in 1990. The ratio of domestic savings to GNP grew from 3.3 percent in 1962 to 35.8 percent in 1989.[38] In 1965 South Korea's rate of growth first exceeded North Korea's rate of growth in most industrial areas, though South Korea's per capita GNP was still lower.[43] 

Singapore also had a Japan-style Ministry of Trade and Industry alongside the Economic Development Board which made targeted investments in education and physical infrastructure in an effort to transform Singapore into a high-income country.

> Economic growth continued throughout the 1980s, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999.

> In the three decades since Lee first became prime minister in 1959 until he stepped aside in 1990, per capita income in the city-state rose by a factor of 29, jumping from around $435 to more than $12,700. 

Taiwan nationalized the banking sector, made extensive use of import licenses, alongside enacting a series of Four-Year Plans. It was during this period where the ""Taiwan Miracle"" occurred:

> Between 1952 and 1982, economic growth was on average 8.7%, and between 1983 and 1986 at 6.9%. The gross national product grew by 360% between 1965 and 1986. The percentage of global exports was over 2% in 1986, over other recently industrialized countries, and the global industrial production output grew a further 680% between 1965 and 1986.

> In 1952, Taiwan had a per capita gross national product (GNP) of $170, placing the island's economy squarely between Zaire and Congo. But, by 2018 Taiwan's per capita GNP, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), had soared to $53,074, around or above some developed West European economies and Japan.

Even in post-war Europe the developmental state model seemed successful, with a number of ""economic miracles"" occurring under the model. During their economic miracle, Italy had the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction, a state holding company which made large-scale targeted investments in physical industry to provide employment and help industrialize. Spain established the National Institute of Industry, which did much of the same things. France had the official economic policy of ""dirigisme"" and substantial state-directed control during the Trente Glorieuses period.

My question to neoliberals is this: 

- How did these countries see such dramatic success while shunning the principles of mainstream development economics?

- Did these countries succeed because of the developmental state, in spite of it, or from something else altogether?

- Could the developmental model be the framework for success for underdeveloped countries today?

- Could already developed countries stand to benefit from adopting the developmental model?",2021-10-26 10:56:30,30

188,qfkq1n,lamp37,"Why do neoliberal economists accept induced demand for traffic, but not for housing?","Genuine question here, as I try to iron out what I see as one of the great intellectual inconsistencies of neoliberalism, that I frequently see here in this sub, and also hold myself: why do we accept induced demand as a major factor in traffic, but not in housing?

[Induced Demand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand) is an economic effect where the supply of a good increases, but  the cost of the good does not decrease (or even increases) due to an influx of demand for the now-cheaper good. 

We take a the idea of induced demand almost as an axiom in neoliberal transportation planning: if you add more lanes to a freeway, it doesn't reduce traffic, because more people choose to drive. The reduced time-costs of driving caused by the new lane are quickly overcome by the latent demand of people who were using other modes of transport until those time costs increase again.

But if somebody tried to make the same argument for housing--that building more in a specific area will cause more people to move there and thus drive prices back up--I think they'd generally be derided in neoliberal circles. We take it as an economic law that building more housing reduces housing prices, even when the  data sometimes has a hard time supporting it. 

So my question: what makes housing so different from traffic that we predict increased supply will have opposite impacts on costs?",2021-10-25 11:38:00,18

Here's the comment I was banned for and what I was replying to:

I just expected them to say ""yes"" and that the pro's outweigh the con's.  Are trans women not biological males?  Should I start saying ""small gamete making humans"" or ""XYers""? Is mentioning biological reality hate speech?

I'm strongly opposed to ""Assigned Male at Birth"" b/c biology is real, humans evolved dimorphic sexes (males and females are different), and I think that term is a lie.  I'd be OK with ""Assigned Male at Conception"" though 😂 .

Hilariously I signed up for reddit with an anonymous account three days ago and tried to be respectful but push back when I see group think.  Yet my first convo in r/neoliberal got me banned.  To me it shows the censorship is even worse than I thought, and I already thought it was bad.

214,phwdwr,labelleprovinceguy,How People See Rent Control: A Distinctly Neoliberal Rant,"Had dinner with a bunch of people last night, including a couple traveling here from from California. We start talking about the recall and shit and they go 'I don't really like Newsom but the real issue is housing costs and getting rid of him won't fix that.' I was like 'Yes smart people very cool.' And then they go 'Fortunately the legislature passed a law limiting rent increases a while back or our rent would have went from 1600 a month to 2100 a month.'

Like Ricky Gervais always says, I should have left it. But I was like 'Well rent control is not the solution. Rent control just protects some to the detriment of others. You need massive building' and they are like 'Well I don't know that might just benefit developers more and without rent control only privileged people will be able to live in nice neighborhoods.' 

Again, should have left it. So I to say to the girl 'You work in tv right' and she goes 'Yeah' and I say to the guy 'And you're in publishing' and he goes 'Yeah why' and I go 'Don't you think that's kind of privileged' (I know, I know don't ever invite me to your dinner party) and they were like 'Well we have loans to pay off.' I showed restraint here but I had to know so I said 'Where you'd go to school.' Turns out they met at UCLA! Two UCLA graduates working in film and publishing respectively saying they need rent control because otherwise only the 'privileged' will enjoy the 'nice areas.' I know full fucking well these people could have afforded the increase in rent but oh no they have loans because they suffered through four years at UCLA. 

The worst part is they are skeptical of more building. I wanted to slap them both with a copy of One Billion Americans and literally knock sense into them :) But I figured I had pissed off my girlfriend enough for one night by talking politics with elite lefties.

[This study investigates change over time in the level of hiring discrimination in US labor markets. We perform a meta-analysis of every available field experiment of hiring discrimination against African Americans or Latinos (n = 28). Together, these studies represent 55,842 applications submitted for 26,326 positions. **We focus on trends since 1989** (n = 24 studies), when field experiments became more common and improved methodologically. Since 1989, whites receive on average 36% more callbacks than African Americans, and 24% more callbacks than Latinos. **We observe no change in the level of hiring discrimination against African Americans over the past 25 years,** although we find modest evidence of a decline in discrimination against Latinos. Accounting for applicant education, applicant gender, study method, occupational groups, and local labor market conditions does little to alter this result. **Contrary to claims of declining discrimination in American society, our estimates suggest that levels of discrimination remain largely unchanged, at least at the point of hire.**](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/41/10870)

225,qgxul3,climate_anxiety_,Neoliberal fever dreams,"I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.
