That type of comment seems to assume that laws should enforce whatever you consider moral, or good. You believe marijuana is good so you want it legalized. Christians think drugs are generally bad, so they must want it illegal, right?

But that's not how this works. That's not the point of libertarianism. If that's your attitude, that's still an authoritarian view coming from YOU, you just happen to agree with some libertarian positions by coincidence...for now.

The government is not supposed to enforce morality, it is supposed to protect freedom. I may believe marijuana is stupid and unhealthy but it's not my job to force a government to tell you what you do with your own body. Similarly, having a government force Christian actions onto non-Christians does not produce Christian outcomes. That doesn't change anyone's heart. It simply prohibits freedom and further encourages resentment. 

Broadly speaking, my idea of libertarianism says you can own anything, believe anything, do what you want, not be unjustly overburdened by govt regulations or taxes - just don't hurt others and you're fine. In your version, everyone must believe in your rules, and allow the things you want (until you change your mind about something, probably). That's a huge difference!!! In practice you're still promoting libertarian laws, but not for the right reasons (maximum freedom, minimum tyranny from govt). It's just because you want to enjoy ""those libertarian things"" like doing drugs. But you still want to control people's beliefs. Thats not a libertarian mindset, thats just someone who wants to do drugs. 

There's nothing about Christianity (or any other religion I'm aware of) that says you can't be libertarian. You can simultaneously believe things are wrong AND not believe in forcing others into it.",2021-11-22 23:47:31,405

For the most part, no one knew how big bitcoin and the crypto space would really be, and most didn't support bitcoin and the concept of cryptocurrency for price gains (Since there wasn't much) but for ideological reasons of freedom from the excessive power that the government holds over us and the monetary system. It nearly breaks my heart that the community has gone so far from the ideals it was based on and has turned more into a circlejerk of people trying to become millionaires rather than on the incredible freeing power that bitcoin and other cryptos can have for the regular, common person. I'm sure this will get lost to the other SHIB X10000 and gov loving posts but I hope some will step back from the intoxicating ideas of getting big gains and focus more on the freedom of decentralized currency and the ideals the crypto community is based on.

im very antiwar, and im very opposed to abusive hierarchy found in government(as well as in any other part of society), but i very much support workers doing what it takes to get the most value for their own labor. i also support a society that can take care of *all* of its people, no matter what. it turns out thats what makes me libertarian-socialist or anarcho-communist, so i roll with it and try to read up on the theory. im no poli-sci expert tho.

i guess that when i vaguely showed disapproval of the central government part is what got me completely banned from r/socialism.

I'm curious to hear from fellow lurkers who find themselves unable to jump into libertarianism philosophy completely, what are the parts keeping you from doing so? My hope is to get some civil (please? Pretty please?) dialog with everyone and hopefully some misconceptions and friendly debates can happen (or as friendly as being on Reddit permits). 

Personally for me, I don't have the faith in free market that seems to be an essential component of libertarianism. The way I see it, if the free market was so great and pesky labor laws and regulations hurt us, why weren't we just in a utopia before these laws were a thing? Why were they necessary to begin with?

Granted I am biased in the regard cuz as someone who is lower class, I feel like in a libertarian society, there wouldn't really be a place for me or anyone below x income. 

So I'm curious to hear from others who find themselves in a similar position politically. And to the subreddit regulars and actual libertarians, I look forward to seeing your thoughts and answers to these doubts and disagreements. Let's just try not to murder each other please.

“Durrr, these dirty antivaxxers are actually intruding on MY freedom to live because they’re LITERALLY PUTTING MY LIFE AT RISK by not getting #jabbed”

First, just to set the record straight: that notion is demonstrably false. COVID vaccines are non-sterilizing—meaning they don’t prevent infection/transmission. [There is zero correlation between vaccination rates and COVID increases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/); vaccine-induced herd-immunity is a meme. [Pfizer shots efficacy at preventing transmission drops to 20% after 4 months](https://www.healio.com/news/primary-care/20211006/pfizer-vaccine-effectiveness-diminishes-against-infection-not-severe-disease), and [vaccinated and unvaccinated covid cases carry similar viral loads](https://www.ucdavis.edu/health/covid-19/news/viral-loads-similar-between-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-people)
The vaccine is great at protecting you from hospitalization/death, but the assertion that a young healthy person getting jabbed is necessary for the well-being of the community is nonsensical. 

But put all that aside. The key issue I have with you pro-mandate/passport “libertarians” is the fact that you refuse to acknowledge that your position is fundamentally authoritarian. You think mandates are justified? Fine, we can debate the merits of your position. But for you to unironically sit here and tell me that government restrictions/impositions are actually libertarian because they might save lives…are you fucking serious? Government overreach is *always* about protecting the ‘greater good’, or as Albert Camus put it: “*The welfare of humanity is always the alibi of tyrants*”. There are an infinity of rules that the government could impose that might theoretically save lives. Why should people be allow to drive, or drink, or smoke, or eat shitty unhealthy food? Because as libertarians, we try as often as possible to uphold the principle that freedom is more important than security. Obviously there must be limits to this, but those limits should be as sparse and as unintrusive as is possible to keep society running. If you’re a libertarian that believes that collective safety is more important than individual liberty under all circumstances, then I’m sorry to tell you: you’re not a libertarian; you’re just hiding behind our banner because it sounds cooler.",2021-11-09 23:09:52,91

The two biggest issues are lies relating to the 2020 presidential election, and COVID. [65% of Republicans believe that President Biden was unlawfully elected.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1261306#blogHeader) Republicans may use this as a pretext to unlawfully seize power themselves. And, of course, the insurrection of 1/6 was a result of these lies.

Also, I don't really have to write for long about lies relating to COVID that circulate on social media. [About 30% of American adults are still unvaccinated.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/11/10/30-of-us-adults-are-still-unvaccinated---heres-what-could-make-them-finally-get-the-shot/?sh=83fd4a63e485) The vaccine is the cheapest, fastest, safest way to end COVID, and we all have o be vaccinated for the disease to be eradicated. But many refuse to get the vaccine, and in doing so, expose themselves and others to unnecessary harm. So many people have forgone the vaccine that [more Americans have actually died in 2021 from COVID than in 2020.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-covid-deaths-2021-vaccines-b1963790.html)

Don't tell me that the truth will always win out. That's clearly wrong. An enormous portion of the population can believe something totally wrong, and in doing so, threaten everyone else — most people do not have to support a coup for it to be successful, and most people do not have to be vaccinated for a disease to be a huge burden on society.

I support free speech, but I think technology has changed things. Voltaire famously said, ""I don't agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."" However, Voltaire never saw the internet. It's much easier for misinformation to spread today than in the past. The internet is far more accessible than print media, and unlike TV and radio, anyone can use the internet as a platform. There are lots of people that news networks and radio stations would not allow to have programs who can say whatever they want on the web. I no longer believe 18th century ideals of free speech are compatible with 21st century technology. 

So what is the libertarian solution to stop the spread of misinformation? Should social media sites like Facebook and Twitter do more to prevent the spread of misinformation? Would this be an instance of justified government intervention? Should the state get involved and remove misinformation from the web?",2021-11-29 07:50:16,8

122,qtokvt,Axenctygutuj,a short story about why a Libertarian utopia,"
I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.",2021-11-14 06:12:13,640

Example on the Left: Pumping money into intercity public schools has the intention of increasing education opportunities for low income areas, but in reality, it leads to massive corrupt bureaucracies and teachers unions, preventing any school choice/ voucher programs which forces more low income students to be locked into the awful public education system. 

I could go on and on with examples on both sides, but the point is, people care more about the intentions than the effectiveness of policies.

Reddit is full of subs that are moderated by tyrants and bullies.  They brook no dissention from their Orthodoxy.  

They respond to such criticism by saying, ""it's my sub, if you don't like it make your own.""  Exactly.  They profess to love freedom, and choice, and diversity except when it comes into conflict with their authority and control.  

Do you think a Communist or socialist society would be any different?  Every Leftists project-- every single one-- becomes a dogmatic, ideological tyranny.  

Why don't they practice what they preach?  

Do you want a government run by reddit mods?

‐---------------


Edit:  lots of people are comparing leftist subs to conservative/ rightwing subs.  Conservatives like strong central authority.  That's part of Conservativism. 
 Conservatives like Kings, gods, police, etc.  Many conservatives say Jesus is their King for crying out loud.   It makes sense that they would want to have authoritarian subreddits.  It doesn't make sense that Leftists would run authoritarian subreddits except when you realize that they're just as authoritarian as the Right.  Thus, they're hypocrites.  They want decentralization of authority except when it's their authority.",2021-11-09 12:34:18,193

140,r0sdg1,Nativereqular,How libertarianism helps poor people,"It's important to explain to people that libertarianism would be good for poor people, but we need to explain how and give real life examples. I have a couple of examples.

**Example 1:**

 Occupational licensing hurts poor people the most. They don't have money to go to classes or pay the license fees and they get stuck in poverty. There's so many barbers or hair braiders in poor communities and they are very good at it, but legally they can't make money off it because they're not licensed. 

**Example 2:**

It took my uncle 5 months to open a food truck here in New Mexico. That's how long it took to get all the requirements and paperwork together. Reducing red tape and regulations would help poor people a lot 

**Example 3:**

I grew up in a trailer park, and my parents started selling candy and ice cream out of our home to all the kids in the trailer park. It would help pay the bills, the owner of the trailer park didn't have a problem with it, but since we had a sign outside, the cops showed up and made us shut it down.

**Example 4:**

I work on doordash and other apps like that. I love it. I don't have a boss, I choose my own hours, and I make more than I did at a minimum wage job. The only bad thing about it is the taxes, cause there's a self employment tax and so the taxes are higher than at a normal job. So that's how the government hurts poor people, but it's still a good gig. In California they tried to force us to be employees instead of independent contractors. Its frustrating that they think they know better than me. I chose this job, if I wanted a normal job I would get a normal job, but I like being an independent contractor. Thank God for doordash and Uber for these opportunities they've created


**Example 5:**

Living in a Hispanic area and being so close to Christmas is what inspired me to write this post because I saw all the old ladies selling tamales out of their truck on the side of the road or outside stores. So many of them get shut down because they don't have permits and it's not inspected, but they should be able to sell their tamales. If you are afraid that it's unsafe then don't buy from them, but let the rest of us live free.

This is what we mean by economic freedom and talking about real life examples like these will show people that we do care about poor people, and that's why we are libertarians",2021-11-23 19:04:56,178

They have not only been caught, but have lobbied to weaken bills that crack down on this. I know Libertarians don't support slavery, but they also don't support state intervention in the market either like laws that punish companies that use forced labor. I've also heard arguments in favor of protectionism that support tariffs on Chinese goods because American/western workers do have hard times competing against workers who don't get wages at all. The argument is similar to the free soil movement in that the free soilers campaigned against slavery in that wage labor will always be more expensive than slave labor and thus hard to make a living. Problem is, Libertarians don't support protectionism either. What is the Libertarian solution to companies who use forced labor in their supply chains?

146,qqsjoo,nixalo,Libertarians rarely offer solutions. It's why it has trouble with popularity.,"I'll say it first. I am no libertarian.

One observation I've noticed about libertarians is they don't offer solutions to problems. They can identify problems. However as a whole, the ideology promotes freedom to a point that it can say where to go forward. Just not where to go.

And this limits libertarianism as humans go to leaders and experts for answers. People with problems, real, perceived, or fake, are going to look to people offering a solution to them. And the people saying ""Do nothing"" will be ignored or seen as annoyances.

It is like the person who objects to places to eat but never offers suggestions or says ""Whereever. Just not X, Y, or Z"".

For example. The Vaccine mandates. You hear a lot of opposition. ""So what should we do?"" Cricket chirping. Owl hooting. Fly buzzing. Silence.

Libertarianism runs into the brick wall of human nature just as hard as some other ideologies. I wish the ideology would learn the word ""Yes"" sometimes.",2021-11-10 05:42:19,20

I got banned for that. Whatever, I didn't mind and a couple of weeks later i'm in r/Anarcho_Capitalism because i like debating them.

Hit them with the wiki articles is what I like to do(below). Show them that it's not an oxymoron, Libertarianism/Socialism are compatible, and they are historically related.

198,qj3qfd,Atomonous,Why do so many of you choose to remain ignorant and ignore the history of libertarianism?,"Libertarianism started as a left wing socialist ideology. The first person to describe their beliefs as “libertarian” was Joseph Déjacque in 1857, and the term was then used to describe socialist/anarchist beliefs for around 100 years, until it was co-opted by the American right in the mid 1900s, and it then became associated with free market capitalism.

This is the verifiable history of libertarianism as an ideology, yet so many right libertarians just completely refuse to accept it. There are constant posts on this sub about how socialists shouldn’t be allowed here, or that libertarian-socialism is an oxymoron, yet the libsocs have been using the term to describe their beliefs for 100 years longer than the rightlibs have. 

A whole range of beliefs fit under the libertarian banner, and we should all be able to share in the use of the term libertarian. It’s ridiculous that so many rightlibs want to exclude people from libertarianism just because they are completely ignorant of, or choose to ignore, the history of the ideology.

How is democracy in the workplace/community not libertarian?","My line of reasoning being: As an anarchist, the whole point of anarchy is to dismantle oppressive and dominating power structures such as dictatorship (dictator over citizen), racism(white over black), patriarchy(man over woman), etc. and make power structures as horizontal(equal) as possible. In the capitalist workplace there is a clearly dominating and oppressive power structure since the capitalist dictates literally everything about a large portion of the workers life (employer over worker). It doesn't matter if the transaction is voluntary or not, it's still dominating and arguably oppressive (but, I know you guys won't accept that, so just focus on the dominating part). While in a democratic workplace there is no domination since all power is equal. I hear you guys say ""but, It's domination over the individual"", but how is it domination if all power is equal and there is no hierarchy? There is no power imbalance since all workers have equal power. I feel like saying ""democracy is domination over the individual"" is like saying ""freedom is the domination of dictators"". But lets say that the majority over the individual IS dominating. How is this worse than an individual dominating the majority? For example let's say there's a workplace of a thousand workers. In a capitalist workplace 1000 workers are dominated by the capitalist, but in the democratic workplace a maximum of 499 workers could be dominated by the majority.

You love the free market, right? You can't criticise them! Leopards got your face huh?""    


Some of the stupidest shit I have ever seen on the Internet to be honest. It is perfectly libertarian to criticise a business. It is perfectly libertarian to refuse to support a private business, and to revile them loudly. Heck, it's perfectly libertarian to organise a fucking protest outside the business' office provided no one's natural rights are being infringed on. It's perfectly libertarian to call for action against businesses that violate the natural rights of individuals.    


Like the entire point of a free market and society is that you're perfectly free to stand on your lawn and scream ""AMAZON SUCKS!"". It is also perfectly libertarian for someone to take offense with that, and go ""AMAZON DOESN'T SUCK!"". The right to voluntary association and free speech doesn't protect you from someone else exercising their right to free speech and criticising you.  It's perfectly libertarian to hate Jeff Bezos. Because Jeff Bezos is a person and not a fucking ideology. If I think he's a dick, anyone going ""oh but you love the free market you should love Bezos"" absolutely fucking not. You can be in support of a free market and be against individuals' actions within that market. *Especially* if said business was the direct or indirect benefactor of government intervention. But that's irrelevant. Even if a business succeeded devoid of government regulation, a libertarian doesn't need to get down on his knees and sing its praises.    


And it's perfectly libertarian to recognise that every single business in a free market is not going to be aligned with every person's views of what it should be doing. Personally I think EA is a shit company and that perfectly aligns with my views as a libertarian. When I start calling for government interference in EA's operations due to my own personal views, *then* it conflicts with my libertarian views.    


TLDR: No, just because you're a libertarian doesn't mean you need to suck the cock of every entrepreneur, capitalist or owner in existence - you're perfectly allowed to viciously and vehemently disagree with them while supporting free societies and markets.",2021-11-15 15:11:56,67

216,q0ty8w,marty_mcclarkey_1791,Lets be real for a moment... the Libertarian Party (LP) needs a climate policy.,"Ignoring the science of climate change for just a moment, if the LP wants to succeed in the future it needs to attract younger voters. Young Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly view climate change as scientific fact (as do I, a 21M college student) and want something done about it. This is understandable, given younger generations will suffer worse consequences of climate change than generations before them.

Going on the moral and specifically libertarian front, greenhouse gases create a negative externality for individuals and business owners (specifically in the tourism, agriculture and real estate industries) that they did not ask for. Furthermore, rising sea levels and increasingly devastating storms directly threaten private property. You can’t tell a hurricane to get off your lawn even if you point the barrel of a gun directly at its eye.

However, the question of what should be done about it is much more difficult to answer. The free market is already investing heavily in solar and wind, and I’m more optimistic when it comes to climate action. However, we need to encourage the market to keep going and pick up the momentum. 

I’m personally more liberal when it comes to climate policy, but I understand the arguments for a more conservative, hands-off approach. Specifically, I would argue for an emissions trading system (similar to cap and trade). This would ideally be put towards the national debt but also to private-public green energy projects, especially nuclear energy.

No sane person would ever want the near totality of their life to be defined by the modern definition of 'employment'. For many, your ceding time, more so than just labour. It's something you have to do, not even ought to. One of the reasons that has led to the phenomena of BS jobs, as Graeber put it. 

It dictates everything about your life. About who you are and what you can do. As Chomsky pointed out, it is one of the most authoritarian institutions of modern life.  

Suburban sprawl and the daily commute of 'modernity' are not, nor have they ever been, a virtue. There can never be any salvation in the perverse way 'working' is defined in the modern world. In so far as life is worth living, it's down to who we meet and love and care for. About truly investing time in what you are passionate about. 

If some lad would rather do a PhD in biblical history or classics then that is far more worthwhile than inputting meaningless data points into an excel sheet, all because some corporate bureaucracy has yet to automate the inevitable.

Pretending otherwise is mostly just a cope or some form of escapism. For the Plebit lolbertarians, it's the fiction that one day they will carve out a strata at the upper echelons of our socio-economic caste system. For liberals and social democrats, it's to mitigate harm and feign empathy. See the discourse on corporate mental health for a perfect example of this. For others, it's booze, sex, entertainment, etc. 

Of course if someone has 'anxiety' or 'depression' about genuine grievances of their own material conditions, the problem is just medicated away. Nothing can fundamentally change, so we just pretend that it's a biological abnormality.",2021-10-17 04:06:26,272

Now yes you can be in the middle when it comes to each. You can be someone who is pro-life but understands that certain caveats should be in place: health of the mother, rape, or incest. As well as you can be a pro-choice person, but feel that abortion after a specific point in a pregnancy should be illegal. 

As I understand it, it is a key concept of libertarianism that the limited need for government includes the need for it to protect peoples individual rights. As such an argument can be made on either side of this issue on whether the government should or should not poke its ugly head into the matter. 

Where I get torn is that while I can see that a woman should have the right to her body and have bodily autonomy, I can also see the the sole need for government in a libertarian mindset is to ensure an individuals right and seeing that the fetus is not a direct copy of the mother and thus its own individual the government should look to protect its right to life. 

This issue will never be an easy one to solve and will continue to be one that people debate constantly and for many more years to come. 

My hope here is to have a discussion with all of you about what you believe. On one side I can see the nervousness and distain against the government pushing its head into someone's choice but I can also see the want for the government to do its one major purpose in a libertarian mindset, which is to protect a persons individual freedom that includes a right to life.

1- It is safe to assume that companies will do everything in their power to ensure their power/brand, for example Disney lobbying to prevent Mickey from entering the public domain; and I don't believe that removing the state for its private equivalent will change anything. What I mean is that if the power of laws/rules are in your favor companies don't do much but if they want something they will do everything to get it.

2- Captalism without regulation is Ouroboros (not eternity but it will eat its own tail), in which case what I mean is that companies will do everything to make a profit even at the expense of their own customers, like Facebbok selling the your personal data, most game companies nowadays, among others.

3- Companies don't have morality as long as they make a profit, this is by far the simplest, Nestle with practically slave/child labor in Africa, Gap and child labor, Disney and animal abuse, Amazon and its employees, practically every company who works with/in China (human rights violation etc), tobacco companies in 3 world countries, among others.

4- From the creators ""if you are homeless buy a house"" comes ""if you don't like your job, change jobs, simple as that"", I don't know if they do it because they want to or simply choose to ignore the nuances that come with the decision to change a job or just getting one.

That's it I'm a little disappointed with the lack of nuance and/or ""sheer naivete"" it could be me but I don't believe that free markets/companies are the answer to everything",2021-11-27 08:11:02,3

“Durrr, these dirty antivaxxers are actually intruding on MY freedom to live because they’re LITERALLY PUTTING MY LIFE AT RISK by not getting #jabbed”

First, just to set the record straight: that notion is demonstrably false. COVID vaccines are non-sterilizing—meaning they don’t prevent infection/transmission. [There is zero correlation between vaccination rates and COVID increases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/); vaccine-induced herd-immunity is a meme. [Pfizer shots efficacy at preventing transmission drops to 20% after 4 months](https://www.healio.com/news/primary-care/20211006/pfizer-vaccine-effectiveness-diminishes-against-infection-not-severe-disease), and [vaccinated and unvaccinated covid cases carry similar viral loads](https://www.ucdavis.edu/health/covid-19/news/viral-loads-similar-between-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-people)
The vaccine is great at protecting you from hospitalization/death, but the assertion that a young healthy person getting jabbed is necessary for the well-being of the community is nonsensical. 

But put all that aside. The key issue I have with you pro-mandate/passport “libertarians” is the fact that you refuse to acknowledge that your position is fundamentally authoritarian. You think mandates are justified? Fine, we can debate the merits of your position. But for you to unironically sit here and tell me that government restrictions/impositions are actually libertarian because they might save lives…are you fucking serious? Government overreach is *always* about protecting the ‘greater good’, or as Albert Camus put it: “*The welfare of humanity is always the alibi of tyrants*”. There are an infinity of rules that the government could impose that might theoretically save lives. Why should people be allow to drive, or drink, or smoke, or eat shitty unhealthy food? Because as libertarians, we try as often as possible to uphold the principle that freedom is more important than security. Obviously there must be limits to this, but those limits should be as sparse and as unintrusive as is possible to keep society running.
