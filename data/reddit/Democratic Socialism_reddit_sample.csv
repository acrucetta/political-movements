Internships are starting next semester and I have about 4 months to prep myself up.

Ive read a lot of posts here and other sites. The fair consensus seems to be to learn DSA and then solve leet code. But it seems pretty vague the path inbetween then and the path to learn DSA.

There are plethora of courses available online and I don't know which one to follow. I want to stick to one source and then switch to others 

I think a lot if people here might have learnt DSA from multiple sources and can somone please suggest which one to choose and how to move forward from there.

How should be the journey to leetcode after DSA. Someone please guide me.",2021-09-13 02:15:48,43

He travelled to Israel to meet FM Lapid. He understands that there are two sides to this and that if the progressive movement wants to bring peace closer, they are going to have to build ties to all in Israel and Palestine who want peace and two states. 

Israel must pull out and end their occupation of the west bank. To do that however, they will need assurances that the west bank wont become another Gaza strip. For Palestine, they need to know Israel is negotiating in good faith and will return East Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital before evacuating settlements. Of course, steps such as leveraging certain supplies to Israel in order to force them to the table will have to be made, but by showing that the US progressive movement, or at least a part of it, recognises and supports Israel's right to exist as well as the Palestinian right to exist, the left can actively help bring peace while still not in power.

16,qxw6gt,JeffB1517,Jamaal Bowman's possible expulsion from DSA. Proof of BDS' real attitude about ending the occupation.,"Quite often BDS defenders like to claim that BDS is just against the occupation.   Quite often we hear people claim that anti-Zionism is essentially nothing more than Liberal Zionism.  There has been an interesting controversy this week regarding Jamaal Bowman which demonstrates how false this narrative is.  

Jamaal Bowman is the representative from NY-16.  In 2020 he beat [Elliot Engel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Engel) a 16 term Jewish congressmen in the primary.   Engel was a moderate democrat and well known as one of AIPAC's strongest congressmen.  The primary took place in a district so blue that Republicans didn't even bother to file a candidate, the primary was literally the election.   The district spans Southern Westchester County and the Bronx which is heavily minority but also includes white districts including Riverdale which is Orthodox but not Hasidic Jewish. Mostly the campaign had to do with economic policy with Engel taking  moderate Democrat positions and Bowman more  progressive ones.  Bowman's campaign focused on  anti-poverty, anti-racism,, housing subsidies, criminal justice reform, education, Medicare for All, and a Green New Deal.  This put him in alignment with the Democratic Socialists of America, and he became a member and one of their poster child candidates.   To some extent Israel was an issue with Bowman being moderate (a Liberal Zionist) vs.  Engel a strong supporter, but it wasn't that much of an issue because how the Jews in the district were going to vote was pretty well know.   Engel's defeat was seen as a blow against ""the Zionist Establishment"" by BDSers, and it is true that pro-Israel groups had spent a ton to help Engel keep his seat.  

&#x200B;

Bowman during the primary was a firm Liberal Zionist there were quotes like, ""*As Netanyahu calls for expanding settlements and annexing the West Bank, we should seriously consider placing conditions on the billions of dollars of military aid our government provides him in order to make sure that the rights and dignity of both the Israeli and Palestinian people are respected,  I just don’t understand why American taxpayers are subsidizing the detention of Palestinian children while Democrats are criticizing child detention at the Mexican border. The principles of the Leahy Law should be upheld.*""    At the same time Bowman refused to endorse BDS, ""*I do not support the BDS movement. I do not support the eradication of Israel. Israel has the right to exist, it has a right to its homeland, it has a right to self determination.*”  His position which contradicted the DSA's was well known before the primary and since.  After winning the primary Bowman as a congressmen he has broken with many of the Democratic Socialists in refusing to be openly hostile to Jewish constituents.   Bowman has consistently shown a willingness to meet with Jewish constituents and address their concerns.  While they are to his right Bowman's Jewish population is not unhappy with their Congressmen and they aren't planning to swing Republican or anything. 

In recent weeks Bowman [voted for Iron Dome funding](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/pvl6r4/who_voted_against_iron_dome_and_likely_why/), *Voting in favor of the Iron Dome defense system is not going stop me from speaking out about Palestinian rights, and for Palestinian rights, and for Palestinian humanity, There’s inhumane treatment happening towards the Palestinians. That is a fact and that is something that we have to deal with in order to ensure the self-determination of Palestinians, and the safety and security of the people of Israel going forward.*”.  Soon after he joined J-Street's (Liberal Zionist lobby) congressional trip to Israel. J-Street's trip has meetings with Palestinians officials and Israeli officials (in this case Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett).  Those are all actions  consistent with his Liberal Zionist beliefs expressed before and after the campaign. 

The Democrat Socialists of America, of which Bowman is a member, are [blowing a gasket](https://i.redd.it/zfj33la222081.jpg).  DSA is in my book openly and officially antisemitic ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/i9nrlk/i_think_its_time_to_say_the_dsa_is_openly/)). It should be noted that DSA had a clear cut position on Congressional Travel to Israel years before Bowman's trip:

>As Israel’s settler colonial regime of occupation and apartheid escalates land and power grabs, our grassroots socialist movement is also building power–and public discourse is shifting in response. DSA has honored the Palestinian call for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions as a tactic to pressure Israel to comply with human rights and international law since 2017.  As our movement has gained ground in many facets of the US political landscape, including major electoral wins, those who hold power in the New York State Assembly are obviously very threatened by us, which means what we’re doing is working. While NYC city council members are regularly taken on an expenses-paid propaganda trip to Israel, millions of Palestinians are still denied the right to return to their homes. **By asking candidates to pledge not to travel on such political junkets,** New York City DSA is saying loud and clear that a candidate who aligns themselves with a violent apartheid regime–a progressive except for Palestine–is no progressive at all.

The DSA Platform explicitly requires its politicians to:

>Stand in solidarity with the Palestinian struggle against apartheid, colonialism, and military occupation, and for equality, human rights, and self-determination, including the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.  
>  
>Discontinue US support of Israel’s oppression of the Palestinian people, including an end to all military aid and resisting the ‘normalization’ of relations between the Israeli government and other governments.  
>  
>Support self-determination for the Palestinian people and a political solution to the current crisis premised on the guarantee of basic human rights, including an end to the military occupation, an end to discrimination against Palestinians within Israel, and the right of return of refugees, as outlined in the call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions.

Bowman was well aware of this position.  DSA was well aware of Bowman's position. 

The National DSA denounced Bowman for traveling to Israel: 

>The National Political Committee is aware of the trip that DSA member and Congressman Jamaal Bowman took to Israel this week, and has received letters from various DSA chapters and members about the situation.  DSA unapologetically stands in solidarity with the Palestinian people in their ongoing struggle for liberation. Our platform proudly states continued support for and involvement with the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, and efforts to eliminate U.S. military aid to Israel, while resisting the “normalization” of relationships between the Israeli government and other governments.  

> The NPC is treating this as its highest priority right now; to work with the DSA BDS & Palestine Solidarity Working Group and the Congressman’s local chapters to address this directly with Representative Bowman. We will be meeting with him in the next few days. We will update the members as soon as possible following that meeting.

DSA’s National BDS and Palestine Solidarity Working Group went even further in explicating their position (note this is an official BDS group, taking an official position on the record regarding a USA Congressmen): 

> Unlike right-wing Zionists, who openly and explicitly state their desire to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from the land, liberal Zionist groups like J Street give lip service to universalistic values of ‘peace’ and ‘democracy’ while still ultimately seeking to maintain a Jewish ethnostate in historic Palestine, In line with their overarching goals, J Street consistently ignores and undermines Palestinian voices and demands. For example, J Street dismisses the self-determination of the Palestinian people by insisting on only supporting a two-state solution to ensure that Israel remains a “democratic homeland for the Jewish people.” J Street also explicitly opposes BDS, which more than 80% of Palestinians support.”  

> Inequality between a planned Jewish majority and the indigenous Palestinian population, who were made a minority in ’48 Palestine (aka present-day Israel) after al Nakba, is and always has been structurally fundamental to Israel,” it continues. “Thus, right-wing and liberal Zionists have in common the perception of the indigenous Palestinian population as a demographic obstacle, and by remaining unaccountable to the racist reality of the Zionist project, liberal Zionists — and the propaganda trips their organizations sponsor — normalize and perpetuate ethnic cleansing and Israeli apartheid.

I'd like to pause here and not the hostility to Liberal Zionism.  BDS defenders often like to deny that BDS formed as a reaction against Liberal Zionism particularly Liberal Zionist Peace Groups.  They were always the #1 enemy. You can hear BDS themselves saying much the same thing.

Luckily now things are beginning to be ok, and I'm excited to make more polls. Also I worry if my focus on electoral stuff with these polls is turning anyone off, I'd appreciate feedback in the comments, and even requests for the next poll!

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In the troubled state of the Great Lakes Government, the establishment struggles with little legitimacy from its own populace. Built on the ashes of the Syndicalist cause, the proletariat seem to resent the Canadian occupation, and the Government must take steps to remedy this. However, while the Politicians, the Generals, and the Businessmen scheme on how to keep their control over the heart of the American Revolution, a resistance faction, known as the Democratic Socialists of America brews, but they are far from United.

Within this resistance, two factions dominate. Prominently there are the reformists. They take the label Radical Socialist to reflect their commitment to the revolutionary goals, however they seek change through the Ballot, rather than fighting. Led by Eugene Dennis, they aim that their reforms can uplift the suffering masses of the Great Lakes and achieve Socialism without the bloodshed of another war and revolution.

His main rival and contemporary, Gus Hall, has different ideas. He always was committed to the Revolution, and he always had taken steps loyal to the Syndicalist cause and Chairman Reed. He hates the Canadian occupation of the Great Lakes, but also sees Dennis's reformists as a betrayal of the revolutionary cause, giving into the Bourgoisie based on myths and propaganda spread to defame the Syndicalist cause. Many of his detractors label him Totalist, comparing him to Mosley, the Jacobins, or Mussolini. But Gus has not yet the opportunity to prove or disprove that sentiment. All he can hope for now is to win the struggle, so the revolutionary masses may never lay down their arms.

These conflicts have fractured the DSA and galvanized their supporters in favor of one side or the other. To win the power struggle, one must achieve the position of chairman above the other, and rally back the support from those alienated to the cause. As for how the DSA may achieve their goals remains to be seen, but the winner of this struggle will decide the future of Great Lakes socialism.

Recently, I started responding back to recruiters on LinkedIn regarding the different positions they have available for me, as I would like to work with enterprise level web application. I had 3 interviews with 3 different companies, and the positions I interviewed for were for frontend developer, UI developer, and web developer, and all of them list React experience as part of their requirements.

I failed all 3 interviews in the first round because all of them were testing me on my knowledge of (DSA) data structure and algorithm, and they never ask me anything about React.

&#x200B;

I am facing issues of low and inconsistent results here with my DSA campaign.  


I am targeting the category of the website with possible 14 000 searches, here I go 56 impressions and 29 clicks in the last two weeks

When I check search term reports I am getting impressions and clicks on brand terms. The budget is sufficient. I am just not seeing traction here.

The campaign is built upon ""page indexation by google""  I excluded web pages like ""contact us"" or ""about us"", language and country targeting is alright

So what I did today and in the last few days. I created a few more ""ad groups""  like ""web pages"" then ""category1"" and ""category2"" which were suggested by google.  


The campaign strategy is set to maximize conversions because it seemed to me that maximizing clicks didn't bring any clicks.",2021-11-27 03:48:40,4

Unfortunately, Asymmetric Encryption is often oversimplified as simply being able to ""*encrypt with one key, and decrypt with the other.*""  **But that definition is *woefully* incomplete**.

I recently published a video on each providing a more thorough definition, including a walk through of the math for both RSA and DH, and a practical description of DSA. **My goal was to *prove* how these alrogithms work, so that you aren't just taking my (or anyone else's) word for it**. 

#### [RSA Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq8gNbvfaoM) [15:47]

Hope these help you.

**Q:  What about Elliptic Curve?**   ^(*Since I'm sure this question will come up*)

Elliptic Curve simply uses one of the above algorithms. To explain it more thoroughly would require another video, but for now, I'll simplify it to say EC uses the above three algorithms with different type of values.  Instead of using whole numbers (1, 2, 3, ... 501, 502, 503, etc...), EC uses coordinates on a curve to represent values.

PS:  About a year ago, [someone posted my Diffie-Hellman infographic to this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/fcedus/i_never_saw_beauty_in_math_until_this_explanation/) (*thanks, /u/pjlmaster !*). It became the [37th top voted post in this subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/top/?t=all&count=25&after=t3_fufk4x#thing_t3_fcedus).

137,q6a57i,mikethetiger_,[IC] DSA 8-Bit,"**UPDATE: So, I received a preliminary quote from SP this morning and it looks like dyesub from them is pretty expensive. So much, that the set cannot be made in the US and be done at an affordable price. After chatting with Trashman, I realize that is why most dyesub PBT is done overseas. Melissa said ""sublimation is very labor intensive"" and that it actually costs more than 2-shot keycaps...at least from SP. With that said, I'm disappointed to announce that DSA 8-Bit will have to be shelved until I can sort out an alternative manufacturer.**


**DSA 8-Bit**

DSA 8-Bit is a keyset that will be manufactured by Signature Plastics in dyesub PBT. With permission from Trashman himself, DSA 8-Bit pays homage to the original XDA run. It uses the original glyphs that were used for the XDA version, but instead of text modifiers uses the brilliant icons that were part of the original keyset. It will be offered in a 40% first base kit, with add-on kits to support other layouts, based on feedback. This set has been secretly developing in the 40% community and will go to group buy in a few weeks (no date is set yet).

* 40% First Base kit
* Add-on kits based on feedback
* Keycap color codes: GDE, GKK
* PBT Dysublimation in DSA profile

Background info: For some context I'm both an EXCO in the Student Council and my UG (level 5 under leadership)

However, I still am somewhat lost and confused on some main points;
1) What are my chances and how do I better prep for it?
2) Which JCs primarily accept Leadership DSAs?
3) How will I be assigned a role in my JC after entering via leadership?
4) Is there a results gap between DSA and JAE pupils in JC?",2021-11-14 18:40:59,5

  With the announcement of a coalition  between the DSA and PSP, an election for common leader has been declared. The candidates are, from moderate to radical:

  Ross Sanchez (Social Democrat Caucus, California). Ross Sanchez campaigns on a platform of expansion to the welfare state and environmental protections. He defeated the Republican candidate in a landslide for his seat in the 2045 election. He has a reputation as a Maverick leader, willing to compromise with various different groups. He has recently, however, come under some scrutiny for allegedly making racist and sexist remarks early in his career. In addition, he is not particularly charismatic and mostly serves as a figurehead for the more moderate members of the DSA and PSP.

  Maria Ficklen (Democratic-Socialist Caucus, Maryland). Maria Ficklen represents the mainstream faction of the DSA. Her platform supports universal healthcare, a green new deal, and an end to foreign interventions. She has a good deal of support from the party establishment. However, she has been accused of vote rigging and corruption.

  Alexie Echo-Hawk (Ecosocialists of America, Oklahoma). Alexie Echo-Hawk is a native American who gained prominence when she led a month-long protest against the building of a pipeline through native land. She espouses a strong environmentalist and left-libertarian ideology. She supports strong regulations on the environment as well as the creation of worker co-ops and decentralization of government power.

  Theodore Fredrickson (Spartacus League-Socialist Labor Movement, Illinois). Theo Fredrickson led an insurgent, but ultimately unsuccessful populist campaign for chairman of the Illinois State Council. He describes himself as a Luxemburgist, believing in widespread reforms including direct democratic elections to most offices, the creation of workers councils, expansion of civil liberties, and the abolition of wage labor and and end to the use of fossil fuels. He has alleged ties to revolutionary socialist groups, and is known for his somewhat eccentric behavior in public and his controversial statements.

  Thomas Browder (Communist League, New York) Thomas Browder is the leader of the hardline Leninist group in the PSP. Ideologically a Marxist-Leninist, Browder is a longtime rival of Fredrickson. He is the great-grandson of 1930s CPUSA leader Earl Browder. He supports a radical transition in America to a socialist republic, which includes total public ownership of the economy and closer relations with China and Cuba.

2. what kind of leadership activities should i take up to boost my portfolio?

3. do i have to get testimonials from teachers/schoolmates for leadership?

5. if i get accepted, what commitments do i have to take up in the jc?

6. what is the difference between dsa and jae application when in jc? maybe the orientation? or just curriculum wise (for hci)

166,q456wp,distortedtheory,"DSA’s total income for 2020 was about $5 million. Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research, a socialist org, received $12.45 million from anon donors through Goldman Sachs’ donor advice fund in 2019.","There is clearly something up here and regardless of your views, leftist orgs should be more transparent about their funding sources. How did People’s Forum ($12 million) and Tricontinental get so much money? People’s Forum is renting out prime real estate in midtown Manhattan to talk about Marxism. 

Also, Codepink received $200k, which I believe means that Goldman chose the nonprofit themselves, since the minimum for the donor to choose is $5 million. edit: Not exactly certain on this though.

Up for sale is a used set of KAT Milkshake Weirdos and new DSA Astrolokeys Alphas

The KAT Milkshake Weirdos were purchased used and I never mounted them myself as they were the wrong profile for what I had in mind. They were well used and I cleaned them once I got them, but stored them away until now. Box and tray are in the condition that I received them in, well used. Please carefully examine the pictures.

The DSA Astrolokeys Alphas are actually alphas from the ""Base Kit"" for a regular full-sized keyboard. I purchased several sets and had these left over. The ""D"" keycap has a machining error and has defective bottom edges on two sides. I posted pictures next to a normal ""M"" key for comparison. Mint condition, never mounted or used, but I inspected them upon receiving them which is how I found the defect. Will ship in bag it came in.

KAT Milkshake Weirdos - $130 (price I paid for them) OBO

DSA Astrolokeys Alphas - $40 (-5$ from retail for defective key) OBO

I'm clearing out some things I don't need anymore to help fund a trip to see someone special.

I had a lot of trouble pricing all of these since I couldn't find any recent sales for any of them. For that reason, I want to make it clear: **I'm open to offers on all items, even if it's far below asking price**. You can send them to me at any time, but I'll probably wait until this listing's been up for a few days before I start considering offers below list price so if you don't hear back from me straight away, don't worry.  Obviously, FCFS at the asking price :)

I'm willing to ship all items internationally. In regards to Wise/bank transfers, I don't have much rep on mechmarket, but I've been active since 2013 on GH/DT with countless (hundreds) sales/trades done. Plenty of people in the community can vouch for me.

**For the NCR set and the Packard Bell, please make sure to inspect the condition albums and writeups fully. They're both used items and have some damages, which I've tried my best to fully document. Especially in the case of OG dyesub sales, this isn't something you often get; usually sets like this will be listed vaguely as ""used"".**

**When I made the listing there was an error in the DSA Granite bundle, I'd forgot to include a kit in the photo galleries. To be clear: Each DSA Granite bundle contains 6 kits and 3 extra spacebars: Elven tongue, common kit, icon modifiers, text modifiers, windows kit, bonus pack, 2x 7u spacebars and 1x 6.25u spacebar.**

But Europe really isn’t that great in the end, it is still a capitalist society built off of imperialism, racism, and obviously the exploitation of workers. We only get to work such a small amount because of the exploitation of poor countries, because our commodities are mostly manufactured there. Our billionaires, royalty, and politicians are also extremely corrupted and exploitative. 

I thought this subreddit was supposed to be anarchist and against the idea of work in general, but now it’s crowded with “democratic socialists” like every subreddit.

264,r3lnr9,TheRareButter,Do you feel like conservatives have played a role in the growth of Democratic Socialists/Progressives?,"Obviously not directly, but here's my thought process, wondering if you would agree.

Indirectly, through something like unintentional reverse psychology.

For example, when conservative media labels everything the Democrats want to do as Socialism, it can and has (in my opinion) birthed 3 thought processes for the left. (While successfully ""rallying the troops"" on the right)

A. ""If all these policies I support are socialism, I guess I'm a democratic socialist."" (Even if they aren't)

B. ""Since the right won't allow us to enforce our policies and label them all socialist, I'm gonna ""**socialist** /s"" even harder!"" 

C. ""After defending democrat policies that have been incorrectly labeled socialism for years and years on end as a Democrat, I've grown to understand Democratic Socialism and prefer it better than our original democrat agenda.""

**Democratic Socialism is not the ""Robin Hood"" party.** Its the workers owning the means of production, whether collectively or as worker co-ops like we have in the US. In ""Market Socialism"" it's just like capitalism, an exact replica, but with universal worker co-ops. Their economic theory is just like a sports league, with businesses as teams and workers as players.

So, when Tucker Carlson or whoever has the spotlight labels everything the Dems attempt as socialism (while a great political weapon and also great for ratings) it creates the vary thing they tried to destroy. 

This is just some thoughts I had, psychology and all that. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.",2021-11-27 14:05:00,7

290,qzxoru,TheRareButter,What do you think of the new wave of politicians who run as a Democratic Socialists but don't propose socialist policies? (explained in the description),"The Democratic Socialist wave has gone from 6,000 in 2016 to over 60,000 in 2019ish and they seem to only be getting bigger with time.

The major thing here is, NONE of them have any Democratic Socialist agenda's. They're all campaigning and creating policies for a capitalist country, henceforth they're Social Democrats.

I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of uproar and disagreements on that, so let me explain.

Socialism **is not** the ""Robin Hood"" political philosophy. Socialism is, basically, cooperative economics instead of competitive economics. It's emphasis is on minimizing worker exploitation.

Socialism itself is when the workers own shares of their workplace, and the community owns the buildings, and business operations gets voted on democratically instead of authoritatively.

The reason people think socialism is is stealing from the rich and giving to the poor is because if it were to be implemented into a capitalist country, business owners would lose a lot of their power, and their property to their workers, in which they'd share. (But the owners would still hold more authority)

That being said, Democratic Socialists in the US haven't had one policy that suggests what socialism is, **the workers owning the means of production**.

Everything they have written legislatively or campaigned for has been rooted within our US capitalisms. M4A, The New Green Deal, 2 years free college, etc. **Like it or not, calling it socialist is by definition, wrong.** Unless the workers own the means of production, it is not socialist.

Now onto the actual question.

What do you think of politicians mislabeling themselves? Surely had Bernie Sanders ran as a social democrat he wouldn't have scared off as many of the democrats has he had.

Now there's thousands of social democrats in the US that think they're Democratic Socialists, who just simply don't have a clue, and there's even more Republicans who *really* don't have a clue.",2021-11-22 16:25:49,0

My question is about how a democratic socialist society would practically function. Essentially I don't want criticisms of capitalism since I already have a very good understanding of Econ and can poke holes in it myself. I want pieces/books that explain how a democratic socialist economy would plan its economy. Also, I don't want any futuristic pieces which assume that we manage to completely automate everything, but rather pieces/books in a late 19th-century or 20th-century framework. The reason I prefer these historical frameworks is that I want to get a background understanding before I read more modern pieces.

Though please note my leftist education is pretty poor. I have only read the communist manifesto, Lenin's state and revolution, and Eduard Bernstein's Evolutionary Socialism: A Criticism and Affirmation.",2021-10-27 15:09:59,23

396,q5ormg,Professor_HyperBeam,Hasan Piker is a Capitalist Entrepreneur not a Democratic Socialist,"After listening to Hasan Piker's explanation of why he's a ""Democratic Socialist"" and Ethan is a ""Social Democrat Capitalist,"" I still see a number of flaws in his self-categorization. I want to say I heard him out. I really did. I even wanted him to change my mind about him, but his inability to understand how his actions go against (most) of his ideology is pretty ridiculous. Let me start with the one thing I do think he's at least making a legit attempt at not becoming: a powerful business manager who disrespects his workers. However, the way he does this is by hiring next to no one and giving them very basic jobs so that he does not lose his creative control. When a entrepreneur does not create jobs for other people, two things happen:

1) They collect the majority of the wealth for themselves (sounds greedy to me)

2) They don't create additional tax revenue streams for the government because every job is also an income tax revenue stream for the state and/or federal government (sounds greedy to me)

Since the backbone of the democratic socialist philosophy is that the rich do not pay their fair share in taxes, Hasan Piker is deciding to become a member of a group who, in his eyes, do not contribute to a tax revenue stream that can be used by the government to create social programs that can benefit the poor and middle class. Until the government does fix their tax codes to look more in alignment with the democratic socialist goals, what extra things will Hasan do to help fund government programs that far exceeds his 47% tax rate that I would think he doesn't think is ""fair"" given his annual income and networth? 

Yes, he says that he brought down the ad revenue to a the lowest Twitch can allow. Yes, he said he allows his small amount of staff to work their own hours and pays them more than what they asked. Congratulations, Hasan. The fact that he has managed to make $2.8M from one of the biggest corporations (Twitch is owned by Amazon as most of y'all know) even with a small amount of ad plays just shows how good Hasan is at making the capitalist system work for him. A person who works the capitalist system to their financial benefit is called a Capitalist! This is not a Democratic Socialist. 

Knowing your market and manufacturing your public image to please your market is the oldest business trick in the book. People widely hate capitalism right now. Admitting you are a capitalist in the way Ethan Klein did is NOT popular. However, saying you are democratic socialist is popular which only boost your public image because it pleases Hasan's market. This is the move of a capitalist entrepreneur. He is SELLING socialism while practicing capitalism. 

Another thing is that his point that he hasn't made a business that is created on the backs of workers is bullshit because his platforms are Google (YouTube) and Amazon (Twitch). If Amazon and Google workers go on strike by the time I am done writing this post, his business is done. Just like his analogy about the entrepreneur who owns a table manufacturing business who can't make tables. He says his business is completely different that that type of business. No it is not, Hasan. His business is dependent on the worker. He is not the only one working to making his business stay afloat. There are tons of workers at Google and Amazon that are working to keep the platform Hasan uses alive. 

He did not convince me that he is a ""democratic socialist.""",2021-10-11 00:10:25,4

I want to edit my Facebook profile to look more like hasanabi. Is he a Democratic socialist or what should I put?

Also what is a tanky and a socdem? And what is a terf?

Can I put a hammer sickle icon in my name or is that something different? Does hasanabi support hamsicks?

Also what is his take on Hasan Minhaj? I unironically can't find any videos of him mentioning him.

How did he learn all this stuff and how is he able to keep up with the news so quickly? I'm so lost when he talks about Marxism and stuff but hopefully I'll learn soon.

I pretty much agree with everything he says except a couple things on feminism though I don't want to get into it now. Key point: Can I still have the Hamsick if I'm not feminist but on board with everything else? is there Anyone else like me here?

Also I like that contra girl he showed today she is super funny!

Also who would you say is hasans biggest inspiration/the person he looks up to the most?

I want to either change my FB last name to that or just change it to piker.

Is his real last name piker? I didn't think Turkish names were like that, but TBH I don't know much about turkey

Also how do I move up from a grey name in that twitch chat? The mods will randomly time me out for literally no reason. Today I did the dankies ad break like everyone else and I didn't even spam it I did it once and now I'm banned until tomorrow from chatting.

Then, after starting a political debate sub, I learned Bernie Sanders is *not* a Democratic Socialist. At least his agenda wasn't. 

Bernie says *he* calls it *Democratic Socialism* even though Democratic Socialism already exists and it's really a Social Democratic agenda. I assume it's a personal thing, since he's closer to being a Socialist in his personal life than a Democrat.

Since Bernie went major and his agenda followed suit, people all over the country claim to be Democratic Socialists. From Bernie to AOC, and so on. 

**Democratic Socialism has existed in other countries for a long time, and isn't what Bernie had proposed**

When people look up Democratic Socialism, trying to understand what's happening in American politics, they get the wrong answer.

A while back I saw a Tweet by Justin Amash thanking AOC for coming to speak to his Political Science class and it hinted the two of them had an amicable relationship. I bring up this small example because even though on the surface both sides look like they have nothing in common, I think Democratic Socialists and Libertarians have a lot more in common than they want to admit and if they worked together we would see a new birth of freedom in this country.

At the end of the day, Libertarians and Democratic Socialists believe that power should not be concentrated into the hands of a few powerful people. For Libertarians, this means the government. For Democratic Socialists, it means a few powerful Corporations and robber barons. Yet both sides desire to protect the masses from malicious authoritative powers, so with that in mind, can both sides unite and form an alliance to eventually win majorities and reform the United States into something that both promotes individual freedom and general welfare? I can see both sides agreeing and making progress on issues like criminal justice reform, voting rights, immigration, social issues, and even education. Tax policy and the economy would a source of divergence. However, if leadership in this alliance put ego aside (a pipe dream I know) I can see the two sides coming up with a tax policy that would be pretty good.

The Red Party, a socialist party has gone from 2.4 % to 4.7% of the votes, breaking the 4% barrier, meaning they will go from one to eight representatives in parlament. This is the first party to ever break the barrier since it was implemented in 1989. The Red Party build their policies on old school Norwegian socialism, drawing on our countries proud labour movement, and want a democratic revolution towards a socialist society.

I don't think you can really change anything with specific individuals in govt being elected. Boots on the ground are the only things that bring about change, as even if you prefer a social democracy, you would need movements in order to scare the government out of continuing the status quo. FDR is a prime example of this.

There is still so much optimism I see for a ""3rd party"" or someone like AOC being president, but I feel like none of these politicians are have as ""progressive"" as they tout themselves as. She still is part of the system.

I know some people will say ""well they have to bend to neoliberalism"", but if everybody thinks like ""well it sucks but we have to beat that liberal drum"" nothing will get done because that is how they will beat us. The 1% continuing to convince the working class they are nothing without them.

Why there is still so much faith in a liberal democracy, even slowly, bringing America socialist policies?

I can understand the appeal of a peaceful means of achieving socialism, but I find that there is very little practicality in the keeping of our current system as the end of said means as if being a socialist doesn't entail one to think that the system is predatory.

i've studied Marxist theory for quite some time now and i've decided to make a reddit account to ask about some common critiques i've compiled that you have about Democratic Socialism.

&#x200B;

1. The main complaint i see is that you affirm that the welfare reforms promoted by DemSocs could be rolled back in any moment. I don't understand how this argument only applies to Social Democracies since we have example of socialist states disappering very easily like in the USSR wher Gorbachev alone managed to destroy socialism in that country; the same could be said about the majority of the other nations of the Soviet Bloc.

&#x200B;

2) Another common critique is that Social Democracy can only exist because it exploits the global south; a case i would like to point out to counter this is the Kerala State of India, long governed by the Communist Party of Kerala (which despite the name is a demsoc party). Despite India in the 60's being a very poor country, it managed to achieve a lasting land reform, intoduced a comprehensive welfare system and reached an high literacy rate.

&#x200B;

3) Social democracies are supporters of imperialism; this is not a necessary feature of the system. An example i could make is that of Olof Palme, Social Democratic prime minister of Sweden, who opposed the Vietnam war, the Pinochet regime and the aparthied in South Africa while he supported the Castro's revolution in Cuba.

&#x200B;

4) Social Democracy keeps the existing capitalist exploitation of surplus value. While this is technically true according to Marxist theory; my doubt is more pragmatic and it concerns how ""worth"" is a revolution for a worker who can enjoy a good quality of life in a democratic socialist system. I don't know exactly how much of the surplus value is extracted from a worker (i couldn't find anything in crude numbers) but is a revolution, with all it's bloodshed and destruction, it's lost lives and economic destitution following the conflict, worth it for just a mere increase (how much could that be to justify it?!) in a worker's money.

With the current labor crisis going on, many people are being forced to take jobs they don't want. Why? Because they need healthcare. Healthcare is a huge bargaining chip for corporations, as paying for your own insurance is exorbitantly expensive. These corporations leverage that power to pay you less and work you more. People are afraid to quit their job, because they're afraid of losing their healthcare. If cheap public healthcare plans were available, it would return a lot of power to the worker, as they would no longer have to fear getting sick or hurt when they're unemployed. They could then leverage this power to get paid a fair wage, and work a fair amount of hours. This can be attained by implementing a public option. A public option means that private hospitals still exist for those who can afford it, but a cheap and affordable state health insurance program exists for the majority of people. Not only is this insurance much cheaper than current insurance plans, but with actual competition, the private insurance companies lose their monopoly and must offer actually competitive rates.

 [A vast majority](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/press-release/poll-democrats-like-public-option-medicare-for-all-but-overall-more-people-support-public-option-including-significant-share-of-republicans/) of Americans support a public option. Democrats and independents *overwhelmingly* support a public option for healthcare, with even Republicans not far from majority support. So if we all want it, where is it? Where is our government representation? In my opinion, when 68% of people support something, it is damn criminal for the government to resist implementing it. It is time for us to catch up to every other developed nation on Earth. Americans used to be trailblazers in coming up with new ways to support its citizens, and the rest of the world looked up to us. Now, we are a laughingstock to the countries that once admired us.


Why do our politicians refuse to give us something so clearly desired? [In a Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/4708/healthcare-system.aspx), 52% of Americans worried a great deal about the affordability and availability of healthcare, with another 28% still fairly worried. 61% of Americans think there are major problems with the healthcare system in the US. The healthcare and insurance industries are simply too powerful. There is a lot of money in these industries, and the lobbyists do not want to lose this money. If these industries are so rich and powerful, imagine what our healthcare could be like with all of the money going towards our people. Healthcare is an inelastic good, and therefore they can charge whatever they want with no consequences. Because what are you going to do? Die? [Americans pay the most by far of any OECD nation](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019), and yet what are the results? Is this really the best system? If it is, why is our life expectancy so much lower than all of these other nations? Why do Americans have over 50% more chronic illnesses than the OECD average?


People take ubers to the hospital because they can't afford the ambulance trip that will cost in the thousands. People will not go to the hospital until they absolutely have to, oftentimes causing whatever ailment they have to become significantly worse by the time they finally go in. [US citizens see a doctor almost half as often as the average among OECD nations](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019). This causes the treatment to be less successful and more expensive. The same study found that Americans have among the highest rates of hospitalizations for preventable illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. So much money could go to helping people heal instead of being used to pay insurance agents whose whole job is to find a way to deny you coverage. So much money could be saved if people weren't afraid to get preventative treatment.


I'm tired of not knowing the price of something before I buy it. How is this allowed? If any other industry did this they would be crucified, and rightfully so. Every time I order my prescription medication, I am told that I will know the price when it is charged to me. That is despicable. As a younger child, I got into a biking accident and was taken to the hospital. The summer camp I was at was far away from the city, and without my parents there I was taken to a hospital outside of my insurance plan. I was given an x-ray, my wound was cleaned with water, rubbing alcohol, and a q-tip. I was then given a band-aid and a cloth sling for my arm. This experience cost my parents $3,500. $50 for a band-aid? What kind of cruel game are they playing?
It's time for us Californians to unite and rise up to change our state for the better. A California with a thriving public option for healthcare would send a message to the rest of the country, paving the way for other states to adopt it and the federal government eventually implementing it across the nation. Let's send a message to the companies that would reduce our health to dollars on paper. [We have the highest rate of avoidable deaths](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019). We are not only worth the money we can pay. We are human beings and we deserve to be treated as such.

How would you respond to Marxist and even conservative/libertarian criticisms of climate change in the context of it being ""more of the status quo""  For example, claims like:

""This is a full out class war that is waged under the titles like the 'Green New Deal', whose project is decreasing the standard of living"" .

Being that there is such a resistance to any reform regarding climate action, I would typically dismiss this as conspiracies.  However, In my opinion, you cant have any sort of reform or movement, if the oceans are  unable to support life, or landmass has been reduced.  I think it is still something we should consider however, do we make this the #1 priority and throw all of our resources at it?

So, is this something Socialism can intrinsically solve? or can climate reform only happen with capitalist reform?

Should we consider the wants and needs of social programs over climate action?  or do you simply believe that climate change is a farce?  or is this fascism as a guise for eco stewardship? OR are there methods that arent being brought up? what about funding and organizing?

624,p8sory,stroxx,Introduction to Democratic Socialism in Wisconsin and how to join a chapter!,"Thank you for visiting! With this post we are hoping to share information and resources to help engage with anyone expressing curiosity or interest in Wisconsin Democratic Socialism. 

**What is Democratic Socialism?**

Whether you’re already familiar with the term, or you’re curious to learn more, it’s important to understand what Democratic Socialism is and how it is different than other ideologies.

* [""What is Democratic Socialism"" on DSAUSA.org](https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/what-is-democratic-socialism/):

> Democratic socialists believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically—to meet public needs, not to make profits for a few. To achieve a more just society, many structures of our government and economy must be radically transformed through greater economic and social democracy so that ordinary Americans can participate in the many decisions that affect our lives.

* [Understanding Democratic Socialism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcAQB3oPzt0) – an introductory video explaining Democratic Socialism and how it compares with different ideologies

* [Democratic Socialism on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism)

* [Socialism for Dummies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysZC0JOYYWw&feature=youtu.be) Youtube video

**Wisconsin’s History of Democratic Socialism**

* [Sewer Socialism on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewer_Socialism) – an American socialist movement centered in Milwaukee, between 1892 to 1960, with origins in the organization of the Social Democratic Party. The name was meant to highlight the success in overhauling the sewer systems, education, and other infrastructure in the city.

* [Social-Democratic Party of Wisconsin on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social-Democratic_Party_of_Wisconsin) – originating as the 1897 state affiliate of the Chicago faction of the Social Democratic Party of America, later becoming the Social-Democratic Party of Wisconsin. The party was responsible for electing the first socialist member of the United States Congress and was the governing party in the city of Milwaukee for many years, electing several long-time mayors

* [Article: When Socialism Was Tried in America—and Was a Smashing Success](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/socialism-milwaukee-democrats-2020/) – “For much of the 20th century, Milwaukee was run by socialists—and Time magazine called it “one of the best-run cities in the U.S.”

**Moving Forward**

Wisconsin is fortunate enough to include a diverse landscape of agriculture, industry, and urban communities. For anyone interested in the ideologies of Democratic Socialism throughout Wisconsin, there are several opportunities worth pursuing, many of which include bridging those communities to benefit all residents’ needs:

* The Wisconsin State AFL-CIO represents union members in the state of Wisconsin by fighting to raise wages, improve workplace safety, protect worker freedom to collectively bargain and for strong contracts that build strong communities. If you are curious about Labor Councils in your area, [scroll down to find the list](https://www.wisaflcio.org/about-us).

* Supporting Wisconsin CSAs (community-supported agriculture programs) helps to bypass large retailers and corporations, instead allowing the purchase of goods and products directly from farmers who receive full financial benefits. You can find more information on CSAs, including resources to becoming a member, [here on the Urban Ecology Center website.](https://urbanecologycenter.org/what-we-do/csa-farmers.html)

* The [Wisconsin Farmers Union]( https://www.wisconsinfarmersunion.com/) is a member-driven organization which is committed to enhancing the quality of life for family farmers, rural communities, and all people through educational opportunities, cooperative endeavors, and civic engagement.

* A Cooperative is an [example]( https://www.commonground.coop/get-the-scoop/blog/cooperatives-and-socialism) of an enterprise democratically owned and managed by its members. Cooperatives can include grocery stores, credit unions, utility companies, and [much more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative#Types_of_cooperatives).  Wisconsin has a number of diverse Cooperatives throughout the state, shown in [this interactive directory](https://uwcc.wisc.edu/wisconsin-co-op-directory/).

**Becoming a Member of DSA**

For those interested in further engagement, please consider becoming a member of the [Democratic Socialists Party of Wisconsin](https://www.dsausa.org/) for news, community engagement, and additional opportunities. There are currently several Wisconsin area chapters you can reach out to and join:

When I bring up Bernie Sanders to republicans, they seems way too far behind on his policies. This post isn't a post about Bernie, just on the new Democratic Socialism wave trending in the US by young voters.

Republicans don't have a clue what democratic socialism is, but if they took time to understand I bet they'd change their stance, or maybe even support it.

Really, it's just super democratics. Labeling it as democratic socialism really shot us in the foot.

The first step is to first have established a liberal democracy. While we are not liberals, a liberal democracy will be nessecary for the transition to Democratic Socialism.

Next the liberal democracy must become a social democracy, and not straight to Democratic Socialism as like I said earlier, things won't go well if we transition too fast.

Then finally, the Social Democracy becomes Democratic Socialist. With a transition done at a steady rate, and whilst maintaining democracy, it could lead to Democratic Socialism succeeding. However the democracy must be maintained as if it isn't, it could lead to authoritarianism happening, which we are against.",2021-08-15 11:56:02,5

I'm wondering, what do communists think of socialism in Latin America that seems to be ""democratic"" in the sense that it's been built through elections? Venezuela, Bolivia, and now Peru. Are these essentially still liberal/capitalist 'democracies' that are building stronger welfare states and nationalizing major industry? Or can we use these countries as examples of places truly building socialism? It seems communists support these countries much more than welfare capitalist states like in Europe, which is understandable as these are places in the global south that seem to be pursuing self determination with these leftist parties. How do people who adhere to a Leninist model analyze these places?",2021-08-07 14:21:50,5

##### Democratic Socialism

The fundamental problem of society is the class conflict between the rich and poor. All other conflicts such as race and religion were artificially created to distract from class conflict. Through democracy, the working class must become aware of this, and use their votes to create a union state where the influence of oligarchs and bureaucrats is outweighed by the will of the people.

# Your furthest ideology:

##### Hoppeanism

While many view democracy as a way to uphold freedom, it divides people into competing factions which leads to chaos and creates demand for a stronger state. A stable dictatorship will ensure that both the personal freedoms and private property of its native citizens are protected indefinitely.

716,p5il7j,whodo-i-thinkiam,"Social Democracy today, democratic socialism tomorrow","It is fascinating to listen to western liberals half heartedly adopt social democratic ideas, and claim they and the social democrats essentially agree on most things, because that claim is so obviously not true. The truth is, liberals resent social democrats because social democrats break one of the cardinal rules of liberalism: they acknowledge the existence of not only negative individual rights and liberties, but positive rights and liberties, also. Liberals primarily see individual rights as the freedom from interference, whether it be the interference of the state or the interference of other rights bearing individuals. Social democrats, on the other hand, acknowledge that individuals should also have some positive rights, such as, the right to a social safety net. This bothers liberals. It uses the concept of individual liberties against them. If someone can have the right to free speech, or the right to property, why can't they also have the right to food, shelter, and medicine. The liberal has an answer, but they don't like to say it out loud because they know it makes them look bad. They know that in order for everyone to have a protected right to food and medicine, some negative, individual rights have to be interfered with, an uncomfortable thought for liberals. Specifically, this means that in order for a country to pay for a public healthcare system, for instance, the government must interfere in the individual right to property to carryout the necessary duty of collecting taxes. 

I am a socialist. I want to bring about a world where everyone has what they need to thrive on a healthy and habitable planet. I believe bringing about such a world necessitates moving beyond a private profit motive for individual capital holders, that the means of production must be owned and controlled by either the community or the workers, or some combination of the two. I also believe in democracy. However flawed the ideas and opinions of the mass of people may seem to some, having the people determine the course of their own society is the only moral choice. Any other system requires that ideas and theories be imposed on the mass of people by an individual or a minority group. That is neither moral nor sustainable. I believe, therefore, that the future should be democratic socialism. I also believe the path to democratic socialism must go through social democracy, because, so long as private capital holders, who are motivated by profit, are the dominant force behind our economic decisions, social democracy is absolutely necessary to minimize the naturally occurring, negative consequences of the capitalism system. In other words, social democracy is necessary for near term harm reduction that liberal democracy simply lacks the tools to achieve.",2021-08-16 10:40:16,2

721,oo2m6h,yeahthartha,"Do you believe democratic socialism is the ideal political orientation? If yes/no, explain why.","What is democratic socialism?

The term generally refers to collectively-owned businesses and forms of government, in which workers and government entities have more control over the means of production and distribution of goods, versus the private ownership and free market that drives capitalism.

Arguments in support:

• This conception of socialism is the very epitome of these freedoms.
• Want ordinary people to have more power in a more democratic system (something not possible in an authoritative communist regime).

Arguments against:

• Some politicians, economists, and theorists have argued that socialism and democracy are incompatible.
• In the past, various self declared socialist states that at one point were committed to the values of personal freedom and agency of the citizen, found themselves clamping down on such freedoms as they went contrary towards their political or economic goals.
