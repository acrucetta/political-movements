13,ik22xf,emsaut,AITA for walking out on a convervation with my friend because he kept bringing up negativity?,"(title typo: I ment converSation)

me: 23f

friend: 24m

This quarentine has been getting to me pretty bad. I already have been getting treatment for my depression but I'm almost constantly in a state of existential dread now and feel out of my depth.

Meditation, exercise, CBD, sun exposure, journaling, all of it feels so pointless when the world feels like it's ending.

I'm just constantly bombarded with bad news all over the world and I'm just so done with the negativity. Like I want to just enjoy myself and laugh for once and ignore it all.

A really close family friend was over and we were in the kitchen talking. He comes over to sleep sometimes at my parents house and he's basically a sibling to me. I mentioned that dread and at a certain point I mentioned that even youtube has started recommending some F-ed up stuff around this gory horror film like some screwed up form of karma. 

I hate horror and I get squeemish easily so I was put off even at the thumbnail. I mentioned this to my friend and he, a horror buff, started going on a tangant about this film. Eventually I was just too grossed out and asked him to stop by repeated why I brought it up in the first place.

He then changed the subject to politics, and that's just a whole other can of worms for my depressive state as mentioned before. Since he has a job that he can use to maintain a sense of normal I don't think he really realizes just how deep the depression runs in me right now.

I stressed to him that I was feeling depressed so I'd rather we keep they conversation light. 

We move on to video games, and are having some fun with it until he starts going on about how single player is pointless and a waste of time because you don't spend that time with anyone else. Given the fact that I play almost exclusively single player I was urked by what he said and felt kind of invalidated for enjoying something silly that gets me through the day. 

Idk I guess my patience had run thin with him. I was too tired and depressed to keep up with it anymore.

I just said, ""Come on, man. That kinda negativity isn't helpful right now.""

""But I mean, like, just hear me out."" he said.

""No, I get it."" and I just kinda left to go to bed.

I know I come off as overly sensitive. I know I am. I feel kinda crappy for walking out like that. I get that it might be unreasonable to expect a conversation to be happy the whole time just because my depressed ass can't handle it. and it feels like a double standard to mention my depression then turning around to expect positivity from someone else.

1. Very conservative - Treat it as a cash account and sell puts only upto $50K of notional value and leave the balance $50K in cash for safety and future opportunities
2. Conservative - Sell puts upto $100K of notional value which will take around 25% of buying power and leave the balance buying power for safety and future opportunities
3. Aggressive - Sell puts upto $100K of notional value and then sell Put Credit Spreads
4. Very Aggressive - Sell puts upto $200k of notional value and take the assignment of shares maximum only upto $100K, close the balance sold puts (even if you have to take a loss) as soon as $100K assignment figure is reached.

In all of above 4 approaches, in worst case scenerio maximum I will be owning shares worth $100K on cost basis so no margin interest will be incurred.

Every approach has it's merits and demerits and depends on the risk appetite of each individual but what is the general consensus here?

Also are there any other better approaches or guidelines on selling puts on margin account?

I am aware of the tastytrade guideline of allocation of buying power according to VIX levels but that is too complicated for me.

My Approach: I am following ""Convervative"" approach at the moment and selling puts only on solid stocks when they have been beaten down.

19,r2sroo,comp-1107,THE CROISSANT TRAIL a mod idea,"***THE CROISSANT TRAIL (1)***

**\*A mod idea:** *2017 french presidential election*\*\*\*\*\*

I've seen people talk about declining the campaign trail to other countries ... France might be a good country to do so, as a semi-presidential regime it has a huge focus on its presidential elections since 1962 (unlike most european democracies who are mostly parliamentary systems). With the chaotic 2022 election coming up it might be fun to make a mod about french elections. However i believe 2017 would be a lot more interesting than 2022, which in my opinion is still too unpredictable to make a mod on anyway....

So why choose the 2017 election ? well it's a rather unique election in french history, for the first time an incumbent president decides not to run and the election is up for grabs for 4-5 main candidates each representing quite different ideologies (the election had a total of 11 official candidates but i won't focus on the small candidates)

I think we could have either one of the five following candidates as an option. While France doesn't have a vice president or any form of ticket for presidential elections. i think the running mate choice would be whoever the candidate plans to nominate prime minister. In real life those are almost never announced before  the election but it could be a fun way of including the running mate part of the game.

&#x200B;

* **Emmanuel MACRON -** ***en marche*** **(liberal-centre)**

&#x200B;

[Emmanuel MACRON](https://preview.redd.it/5ak71yiszy181.jpg?width=2216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7ba454f43030a0a04d8247859a2af4c7670bf22)

A former banker, turned minister of the economy in Hollande's cabinet, macron is a new figure in the political landscape. Rather young (39 at the time of the election) he campaigns on the idea of changing politics by letting a new generation take the lead and govern beyond partisan lines. There is a lot of subject on which he hasn't taken sides, some accuse him of standing for nothing as his platform will not be released until the last minute and still comes off as kind of vague (but that might be a good way to keep you from alienating any voter block)

*Positions : Pro-buisness, Pro-europe, somewhat progressive on social issues*

*Flaws :* Macron's youth and unexperience while appealing to some could become a problem as france isn't used to having young presidents ; He also runs with the support of a new mouvement he created claiming to be neither left nor right and might need big name endorsements to bring credibility to his campaign. There is also the issue of embracing or denouncing the legacy of the widely unpopular president Fran√ßois Hollande.

*Possible running mates:*

\- Fran√ßois Bayrou : the ultimate centrist politician, candidate for various centrist parties since 2002 he came close to making it into the runoff in 2007. While he initially supported moderate candidate Alain Jupp√© in the republican primary, he would be open to join macron's campaign.

\- Edouard Phillipe : while relatively unknown to the national scene, the mayor of the havre and Jupp√©'s political heir could appeal to moderate republicans thrown off by Fran√ßois Fillon. (he became macron's PM in our timeline)

\- Sylvie Goulard : centrist in the line of Bayrou, strong supporter of the EU

&#x200B;

* **Marine LEPEN -** ***National front*** **(far right)**

&#x200B;

[Marine LEPEN](https://preview.redd.it/xkyk0j8qzy181.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7e2830c4d29ead3f5b7c22ee5047fe7c2e75f8e)

Leader of the National Front since 2011, marine Le Pen has started a process of de-diabolization of her party. She's still considered as far right however and most parties agree that they would team up against her in the runoff. She needs to open up to the traditional right while not angering her far right base. 

*Positions :* Againt-EU, strong on immigration, protectionist but vague on other economic issues

*Flaws :* In the mind of many, the national front is strongly associated with racism and xenophobia ; Le Pen will also face a political scandal about  her party's parliamentary assistants in the EU parliament.

*Possible running mates :*

\- Nicolas Dupont Aignan : Currently a minor candidate for Stand Up France, a right to far-right Gaullist small party. He's more moderate than le pen but quite protectionist. While he has openly criticized Le Pen and said he'd never vote for her, he might turn his back on his convictions in exchange for a government agreement (he did so in our timeline before the runoff, and was promised to be PM)

\- Florian Philippot : A young rising star within the party, Le Pen's number 2 could represent the new wing of the party. He leans left on economics which could be a plus or a minus depending on your goals. However he lacks experience having only served as a European deputy.

\- Marion Marechal Le Pen : Marine's young niece she's considered as a rising star in the party serving as one of the national front's only deputies in the national assembly since 2012. she's much more conservative than her aunt especially on social and economic issues where marine Le Pen has taken a more moderate tone.

&#x200B;

* **Fran√ßois FILLON -** ***The republicans*** **(traditional right)**

&#x200B;

[Fran√ßois FILLON](https://preview.redd.it/asm1pk6j1z181.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98ee9b6ae4ed8959a0bd0a426ed4761f86e25c56)

Former prime minister under president Sarkozy, Fillon won a surprise victory in the republicans primary against favorite Alain Jupp√©. He has taken really conservative position on economics, branding himself as thatcher-reagan type. He is considered to be the favorite at the start of the election.

*Positions :* advocate for fiscal responsability, pro EU, somewhat conservative on social issues

*Flaws :* will face the penelope-gate scandal which will seriously damage his campaign

*Possible running mate :*

\- Fran√ßois Baroin : Former minister of the economy, he's a young rising star within the party that all republicans can get behind. Charming and popular he might contrast with Fillon's age and sobering personnality

\- Bruno Retailleau : Conservative senator from the same wing of the party as Fillon, he would double down on Fillon's religious and convervative appeal

&#x200B;

* **Jean Luc MELENCHON -** ***Unbeant France*** **(Populist Left)**

[Jean Luc MELENCHON](https://preview.redd.it/sg8n5m9q4z181.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e72d373c5a24999740d1276a8d49b9b57a64a140)

Jean Luc M√©lenchon broke away from the socialists in 2008 to create his own populist left wing faction. He's a strong advocate of the creation of a 6th republic with a new constitution. He ran in 2012 on a more radical protectionist platform and might need to moderate his tone to appeal to socialists. 

*Positions :* Protectionist, progressive, left wing economics, 

*Flaws* : M√©lenchon is still a polarizing figure for many socialists ; Also, his support of the Venezuelan government and other south american left wing countries are controversial.

*Running mates :* 

\- Anyone from his party really but i can't think of anyone that stands out (maybe Cl√©mentine Autain)

\- Fran√ßois Ruffin : Left wing documentary director.

\- Benoit Hamon : Currently running as the socialist candidate, Hamon is ideologically close to M√©lenchon on a lot of issues. A lot of people on the left believe that the only chance for either candidate to win is to broker a deal with the other one for a fusion ticket.

&#x200B;

* **Benoit HAMON -** ***Socialist Party*** **(Social democrat)**

[Benoit HAMON](https://preview.redd.it/kzeyso2i4z181.jpg?width=350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69d96a4f8efec5084f115734409f31091bd6b191)

Benoit Hamon was one of the leading voices of the opposition to president Fran√ßois Hollande within his own party. He won a surprise victory in the socialist primary as the most left leaning candidate. He managed to gain the support of the green party who withdrew their candidate Yannick Jadot. Some of his key positions are the legalization of marijuana and a 1000 euros minimum income (*George Mc Govern flashbacks*) 

*Positions :* Pro-EU, progressive, left wing economics, 

*Flaws* : Hamon isn't the most exciting candidate and is facing an uphill battle as the moderate wing of the party is joing 

*Running mates :* 

\- Yannick Jadot : The former green party candidate dropped out to join Hamon's campaign 

\- Manuel Valls : Former prime minister and Hamon's main rival for the nomination. he hails from the most moderate wing of the party he's opposed to Hamon on a lot of issues and is way closer to Emmanuel Macron. He could be a way to pander to moderate voters but Valls is somewhat unpopular nationwide. It is also worth noting that Hamon and Valls despise each other.

\- Arnaud Montebourg : Another contender for the socialist primary, from the same wing of the party as Hamon. he's a left wing protectionist in the style of M√©lenchon but more moderate.",2021-11-26 11:48:50,46

21,90dpw0,Kiewotiue,What of these claims made by my uncritical liberal mum are right about the convervatives and what are just blaming and shaming?,"My mum is a real idealist liberal. I never used to question that being a lefty was 'the right thing' because all my family are and was mostly taught convervatives are heartless and evil and want to crush the poor to keep the bigwigs in power but as I have been able to see videos online mostly of indepedent videos on the right they seem alot more down to earth than what the left leaning interpretations paint them out to be.

Since I have been self employed I have become alot more understanding of the convervative philosophy of not wanting to deinsentivise work through overreliance on welfare. It has nothing to do with 'being selfish' for the tax breaks etc but just for the simple fact that I have come more and more to see how myself being the biggest example and generally other people I see in the world become less motivated to work if they rely on the system for support.

I was told by my mum I am a hypocrit if I support the conservatives because I have claimed benefits for years while my business was not on the up and up but is that true? I asked that once before and was told that the left do not have a monopoloy on the welfare system. It is not that I don't believe in the welfare system it is just I think the left like to enable people too much and give the benefit of the doubt when they shouldn't; like when you spoil a child they will not appreciate things.

Although that brings me to another of the points- I know alot of the scorn in the media has been about the tories cutting off legitimately disabled people which of course I would not support. So is that something they are guilty of? I certainly would not stand by that.

I do not really know where I fall and I find it hard to sort out real facts from what the opposition are just saying to make the other side look bad.

For instance my mum always says the tories have made the deficit bigger with their budget cuts so all their cutting has been a failure while the poor are worse off all the while with the tories saying things have improved with more jobs being available. I don't really know how one goes about finding what is true since everyone can bend statistics to their own ends can't they?

I am not saying some of her left views are wrong (I don't know enought to say either way) but I realise now that she doesn't do any fact checking at all and just unquestioning relies solely on bbc which is known as very biased towards the left and other mainstream (left) news outlets. So it has made me skeptical of the left's claims and wanting to see what is closer to fact or fiction.

I can't remember any more particular points at the moment which are made to sully the right- maybe if you know more of the common accusations aimed at them you could say what of them are true vs what aren't. I doubt about getting to absolute facts with this statistical gymnastics both sides play but maybe the closest interpretation to true?

In general though conservative ideals sound like they support traditionalism and old time honoured values which I support. I don't mean like racism etc that they get accused of but rather not just adopting any latest ridiculous trend for the sake of being PC which the left seem to do.",2018-07-20 01:45:40,0

Well that s pretty much the situation with Arena.

Wizard, please just support all smartphones that meet some minimum specs, for ex with at least 4 GB of ram and a chipset above snapdragon 765G instead of having to add devices one by one.

There are so many Android devices that you cannot test them each invididually. Litteraly there s more than one device per day being released.

I ve never seem a game that is so convervative with specs. I know Wizard does that to avoid negative reviews of idiots who install Arena on a 100$ cheapo smartphone and then complain that it doesnt work but

1. They get waaay more negativity by not officially supporting 90% of the android smartphones, it s just that those users don t vote so you don t see it.
2. With the minimum specs I mentionned above (4GB RAM, above snapdragon 765G), you ll avoid those cases

Please act quickly before people get tired of Arena and move to something else. Right now you still have the excuse of being the best TCG game (on mobile) but soon that novelty will wear off.

Right now, those users like me with an unsupported device that can perfectly run the game have to side load the 1GB APK and redownload >1GB of updates each time you update your client. That s quite annoying when you don't have access to wifi and want to play the game.

PS: my device is the ZTE Axon 20 5G, it s a great upper midrange phone sporting a 6.9 inch screen with the front camera hidden under the display.

So much for ""freedom"" (in my opinion true freedom includes freedom for kids to socialise and learn).

An ideal system would be one where there is a system of checks and balances not only to prevent government overreach but also to prevent parents and cults from abusing kids in the name of ""freedom"". An example of such system of checks and balances would be banning homeschooling (even if the parents are qualified to teach since homeschooling, with few exceptions, is socially-isolating) with few exceptions.",2021-10-17 05:21:58,72

Basically islam wins from liberalism because it defends islam and islam benefits from conservatism because it shares similarities with islamic values.",2021-09-28 03:11:29,62

I'm an ENFP btw. Sometimes he reminds me of my ISFX mom, just less religious and less convervative.

So, let me describe him a bit. 

1. He grew up being introverted but practices and practices to be extroverted. 

2. He dislikes people that are loud, into partying or doing all the wild things. He would find it embarrassing and hate it if I were to do all these in a public space. So, he might definitely dislike some ESFPs or ESTPs. 

3. Honest, affectionate, and straightforward.

4. He loves someone that is ambitious, optimist, a good listener, and cooks. So, he loves someone a bit like a traditional housewife?

5. He's a pretty creative person. He likes to draw and has his own drawing tablet and an art reference book. 

6. Strictly doesn't drink or smoke and doesn't see the point on going to nightclubs.

7. He did mentioned that he usually starts his day and going to work like autopiloting. 

8. He loves anime and gaming! 

9.He has a good fashion sense to recommend to me, what hair colors look good on me and which one doesn't.

10. Focused on learning to improve himself and being productive. If I ever procrastinate, he'd tell me to think about my goals and that I needed to focus on my skills so I can be able to live with him. 

11. Prefers neutral or dark colors rather than bright ones.

12. Cares for his family a lot.

13. Doesn't like museums.


So I think that should be it? I don't know guys. Does he sound like an ISFP? Or an ISFJ to me?",2021-08-07 23:42:56,5
55,pu241a,JDWWV,Self indulgence for visibility day - never told my story to anybody,"This is a really long post that I would not actually expect anyone to read.  But it's the first time telling my story to anyone other than myself and my wife.  This reddit was really helpful to me in figuring things out.  May be that this post helps someone else.  In any event, it helps me to post it, and this seems like a good day to do it.

I am bisexual.  I am 46, and only said this out loud for the first time this spring when I first told myself, and then told my wife.  I always have been bi I guess.  But I just didn't figure it out until the self reflection that accompanied middle age.  

When I was really young - a kid really, I played with guy and girl friends.  As high school got underway, that became just girls.  It's probably not that I was not attracted to guys, but more that I was attracted girls, and scared of what either guys or girls would say or do.  The attraction to girls was stronger.   And I really did feel, I don't think incorrectly, that if I admitted attraction to dudes, girls would think I was guys and want nothing to do with me - in the 1990's, this attitude was pervasive, indeed, being espoused by no less than Dan Savage in his old ""hey faggot"" column (which is hard to believe reading him now).  So, I kept it hidden.  Hidden to the point  that there were straight things I wouldn't do - like play with girls asses (which I know is dumb).   

Eventually I hooked up with my wife.  She comes from a background and family that could not be further from being social convervative - all her parents are LGBTQ+.  Funnily, this didn't make it any easier to recognize myself, let alone come out to her.  Coming out was wrapped up in a lot of baggage.  In any event, I kept my feelings hidden from myself, and from her. I guess, despite out playing with toys, and indeed orally bi swaps with another couple, I did notspend any time reflecting and had nothing to say and she just put all this stuff down to mee having a high sex drive a d being kinky. Over time, out play evolved to the point that it was- with toys- pretty full on bi.  The implications were and remained un examined by me, and unspoken by us. That unspokenness eventually began to eat at me.  It was the elephant in the room, and made our interactions less honest, and more awkward.  It made me worry about what she thought.  

So I spent time in self reflection.  I spent time reading reddit and other resources.   I figured myself out, and I figured out how to raise this with her in a loving and respectful way.  I was scared shitless before I did.  Scared she would take it badly.  Scared she would think I wanted to leave her, or that this was a first step down that road.  But I felt like I was getting old, and that the time for living was passing me by and I didn't want to live other than authentically.  I wanted her to know and I wanted my biness - whatever that would mean -  to be our thing, not just mine. 

We talked inthe spring  I don't think I was super clear with what I wanted or wanted next.  I saw that as a great coming out that would change things.  Because we had been playing with toys for so long, she saw it as a nothing - a confirmation of what she had already known that required no changes.  I knew it could take time for her to process, so left it alone for her to bring up, unaware that she didn't see the need.  Life gets in the way, and months went by without further conversation.  I grew almost despondent.  Our play seemed like a dirty secret, and my orientation not real.  So I read more, including the Mark Bentley Cohen stuff, and brought up talking about it again.  It took a while to get to - talking about talking about it and such, but eventually we did.  I get the sense that people don't like the Cohen book  I can see that - my wife thought it wasa little pushy on opening a relationship- but my takeaway was that you have to talk and figure out what works for you.  What goes far enough to acknowledge the identity of the ""newly"" bi spouse, while also acknowledging the interests of the still straight spouse.

Anyway, we had this talk.  We talked about what being bi meant, about needs, wants, maybes and no's, and where I am on kinsey.  The last of these was interesting and shows the need to talk - I am a 2 or 2.5, but she assumed 4 or 5 (because I felt the need to talk about it).  The most important talk, practically, was the needs and wants.  My needs are pretty simple - I need life breathed into my biness as something we can acknowledge and talk about, so that it doesn't feel like a dirty shameful secret that lives under the stairs, and I need a sexual outlet for it, be that toys or porn or conversation.  My wife can live with these needs.  She needs to know that I love her and will stay a good husband and father.  She needs that this is not all our lives are or are about.  Having that, indeed of practical focus on needs and wants really helped us - it gave the conversation a concreteness and made it a problem solving exercise we could both participate in.  The key to its success was that we both acknowledged that we needed to use the words ""need"" and ""no"" very sparingly as o that we could remain felixible and accommodating and real recognize how important we were to each other.  

At the end, I can and want to give her what she needs, and she can and wants to give me what I need.  We are doing weekly conversations to check how things are going  she is trying to do something small to acknowledge my biness every day or so, and trying to do something bi in our sex every week.  I find, with her doing these things, I don't feel the need to think about this nearly as much.  Someday, I may feel ,Ike I need to experience certain things with a man.  That will be a tough bridge to cross, but think that we now both feel like we are in a good place to have that conversation and to work throught that should we get there.  I have found that as my needs for recognition and a monogamous outlet are more realized, the feeling for a need of real interaction has downgraded to a want.  

The key to us seems to be to recognize that you are in this together and focus conversations on practical ways to make it work that you can both live with, and to be flexible in recognizing there are many ways to fill needs.",2021-09-23 13:57:37,8

Convervative values will always be a harder sell. It‚Äôs not comfortable/fun to follow the rules and restrictions. Liberalism will always appeal to the masses. Because convenience/irresponsibility is always easier than discipline.

70,m1s2f4,Wooden_Insurance_743,How can protestants be saved? Trying to grasp Catholic soteriology.,"Hello, 

Thank you for taking my question. I am am evangelical Protestant who feels intensely drawn to Catholicism and so am exploring/ reading. 

My question is this: 

I have heard and read many Catholics say that they consider Protestants to be Christian brothers and sisters (they seem to be much more ecumenical than convervative protestants). 

But I don't understand how these Protestants (like me at the moment), can be saved according to Catholic soteriology. Because it seems that we've all committed mortal sin at some point in our lives (I've had a troubled history with porn and masturbation, for example). And yet I understand that you guys believe that forgiveness only comes through the sacrament of reconciliation, or (occasionally) a Christian repenting with perfect contrition. Obviously the former doesn't apply to protestants, and I can't realistically see how the latter can apply to anyone to the extent implied. 

So my question is: according to Catholic soteriology, how can anyone¬† be saved except a Catholic in a state of grace?

Thanks in advance!",2021-03-10 01:25:58,39

72,ltqd4u,oll22344,He keeps breaking his own no-contact rule,"Hey! 

*early thirties 

Just looking for some opinions, your experiences and for y‚Äôall to bring me back to reality etc!! 

Got to know someone for about 6 weeks (met online, haven‚Äôt met in person due to lockdown). We would speak on the phone for hours each day, FaceTime etc... we instantly clicked and it‚Äôs like it was meant to be. Sounds so cringe and cliche but he really was the ideal, knew how to treat a lady with respect, good career, similar hobbies etc. We realised we had mutuals and they‚Äôve all vouched for him too. I‚Äôd say we are both from fairly traditional and convervative families. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm a year older and I would ideally like to settle down very soon. I feel once you hit your thirties as a woman you realise what it is you want and for me, I‚Äôve done the whole career thing. I want to settle down, get married and raise a family. 

From the start, he had said to me he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúlooking‚Äù and that it‚Äôs really thrown him off at how well we were getting on etc. We discussed future plans etc and I had compromised on an extra year in addition to the getting to know you phase. Everything was fine but we both kept discussing our concerns about our time frame. 

He then said he wanted to have a chat. Basically, he said he wants to travel, work abroad and continue to build a career and he doesn‚Äôt want us to continue talking as his timeframe for settling is 4 years or so and he is worried about wasting my time if it did transpire to something. 

Obviously we were both gutted because of the instant connection and he said had this been years later, or if we‚Äôd met years earlier it would have been different it‚Äôs just the end goal timeframe is massively off - we are talking 3/4 years (I know him things are heightened online and in a lockdown!! but this one was genuinely abit different... I‚Äôve had a good few talking stages in lockdown) 

Anyways, he suggested no contact. This isn‚Äôt something I wanted as I didn‚Äôt want to lose him as a friend but he said because we had spoke most of the day everyday for weeks going cold turkey would be best. 

It‚Äôs been 2 weeks. He‚Äôs broke his own no-contact rule 4 times, 3 times of which I‚Äôve replied and we‚Äôve kept it civil nothing more. He‚Äôs been checking if I‚Äôm okay. 

What does this mean? We had originally said we would review post lockdown if our situations changed but we had agreed no contact until after lockdown. He isn‚Äôt sticking to the rule. 




Short version: met someone online who ticks all the boxes, realised we have mutuals and they vouch for him. Spoke all day err day for about 6 weeks. Our settling down timeframes differ by about 3 years. He wanted to stop comms and go cold turkey with no contact. He‚Äôs broken the rule 4 times, to which I‚Äôve replied 3 times. What does this mean?

Edit: another message since I wrote this a few hours ago ü•¥

Edit again: I said outright if it‚Äôs not going anywhere then to stop comms. He said our time frames are too different and there is no point in reassessing the sitch in a few months time (even tho he suggested this before). I got the, ‚ÄúI was only trying to be a good human by checking how you were‚Äù. Anyways ive told him there‚Äôs no point in communicating any further so I‚Äôve deleted him off socials. I haven‚Äôt quite blocked yet but if there is further contact made I will. Thanks everyone! Now I feel like he‚Äôs just used me which is annoying af, such a waste of time and energy!",2021-02-27 09:26:19,2

77,nehped,mathcalO_X,Transitioning from mathematics into conservation?,"Hi everyone! Farily new to reddit, so appologies if this isn't an appropriate post for this sub. Nonetheless, I thought I'd give it a shot, and ask my questions here!

I am 24 years old, living in/from Canada, and just started a PhD in pure math. I have a bachelors and masters degree in pure math as well. For the past 4-5 years, my ultimate career goal has been academia and getting a tenure track position in pure math. However, recently I've been having strong doubts about if this is the path I truly want to try for (I say ""try for"", because securing an academic position is extremely difficult, and many sacrifices (family, location, etc) must be made). 

I'm very fond/excited about the idea of pursing a career in wildlife conservation/restoration/ecology. From what i've gathered, there are a million different paths one can take in this field. And of course, with basically zero exerpience in wildelife conservation, it's tough to know exactly  what I want to do and what qualifications I will need.

This is what I know: 

* I absolutely love animals/nature, and would love to help protect/restore and maintain the health of our beautiful planet. The idea of nursing a baby chipmunk back to health warms my soul - I know that rehablilation is often very low wage or volunteer work, so if anything, I would take this up as a side volunteer gig :) .
* The main reason I am thinking about switching into conservation is because I want a career that is not only meaningful to me, but will make an impact on the world around us. My current research, although I love it and it contributes to the advancement of education, it definitely doesn't have an impact on the physical world around us (not yet at least, maybe in 100000 years).
* I love research, so I think I might enjoy a position as an academic in wildelife conservation. 
* I like the idea of being outside, doing ""field work"" as they say. However, I think I would also enjoy a mix of outside work, and inside data crunching work!
* Although not set in stone, I'm interested in having a career in Canada (and doing the necessary education in Canada).
* The type of math I do won't directly help me in convervation. However, I know some stats and programming, and would have no issue picking up the neceassary computer skills needed.

My questions for you all:

1. What is your experience in conservation? (I know this is vague, so take it as you wish)
2. What are your day-to-day roles?
3. What are the hours like? 9-5 type job? weekends off? etc..?
4. Are the jobs very location restricted?
5. What qualifications are needed for a job in conservation? (I know this will depend a lot on what type of job one wants). 
6. Should I get education in ecology? wildelife conservation? forestry? ...?
7. Following up on questions 5-6, some options I've come to are:  I might be able to get an after-degree in ecology (or related field) at the same university I did my bachelors, north american wildlife technology association programs are an option, masters + PhD??

All advice is welcomed, and much appreciated!",2021-05-17 09:27:45,2
78,jepzoe,__aintit__,Charitable Interpretation of Fundamental Difference Between Conservative and Liberal,"Had this thought, figured you lot would be best to tear it apart:

""Liberals desire that the Government do good things. Convervatives desire that the Government not do evil things.""

It's not that Liberals do want evil or Conservatives don't want good, it's just not their primary desire for government. Most of the disagreement ends up being: 

* Liberals think Conversatives don't want the government to help out the needy. 
* Conservatives think Liberal's attempts at good will quickly cause more harm than good.",2020-10-20 08:57:57,62
79,o70fwy,HibikiSS,"[Meta] The Jesuit technocracy needs to be stopped, we have to think about nationalist strategies of revolution.","Hello there. Those who follow me know that I believe the Vatican/Jesuits run the NWO and are seeking to force their technocracy on everyone soon enough. I was thinking that the first step to resist them would be forming counter-intelligence groups so here is my idea.

I created a sub Saidit called [s/NationalistRevolution](https://saidit.net/s/NationalistRevolution/) that I want to use as a counter-intelligence site, but I also want it to be a friendly guild of nationalists everywhere. We have to think about strategies to beat the Vatican so this is the first step. I believe that a simultaneous revolution would have to happen in both Russia and the US, but that would require a very good organization. I also have the [s/Jesuits](https://saidit.net/s/Jesuits/) sub Saidit in which you can find more info about them, I want both places to work together when it comes to intelligence and of course, if you aren't familiar with Saidit itself then start supporting it too:

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/o05m9r/meta_the_conspiracy_community_has_to_take_action/

Please help in any way you can, it will take a lot of effort to start putting some pressure on them but we can start resisting the CIA and the Vatican this way.

Also, a friendly warning to all nationalists in the US... what the CIA is currently planning to do is cause a major fight between both sides in under to destroy the right. Unlike what you may see in the media, Trump is actually a part of it and is probably one of the leading figures when it comes to the movement.

80,ismii9,daaviU,Vanderbilt Vibe Check Provided,"What‚Äôs up, I‚Äôm a Senior at Vanderbilt and I‚Äôm stopping back here for some nostalgia and to pass on some good info. 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of people asking for vibe checks and things like that to help them choose where to apply so I wanted to provide a pretty candid breakdown of my Vandy experience. Let me know if you guys like this as I can get friends at other schools to do reflections as well, and can try to post essays and other things that worked too!

**Why did you choose this school?:**

It was the best and cheapest school that I got into. I didn‚Äôt have an amazing visit, I was a little apprehensive about greek life and being in the South (I‚Äôm from Boston). But I kinda knew that I had to suck that up or spend a lot of money to go somewhere else. 

**What is your school known for? What is its reputation?:**

Vanderbilt is known for its work hard-play hard mentality, for being an elite school in the South with strong academics, athletics (we just won the baseball National Championship), greek life, and for having a very wealthy student body.

**Is this reputation accurate?:**

Everything I wrote above is accurate. I don't think Vanderbilt is quite the party school that it's reputation makes it out to be, especially as the administration takes strides to water down Greek life. In terms of wealth, Vandy has the highest percentage of students from the top 1% of any college in America. Our baseball team is filthy but our football team is one of the worst in the SEC. 

**What are you involved with on campus?:**

I‚Äôm in a fraternity, I play club baseball, I coach a little league basketball team in Nashville, and I was a VUceptor (mentor for first-year students). 

**What do you think your school offers that no other school does?:**

A strong greek life presence combined with the personalization and resources of a small liberal arts college, incredible location in the heart of Nashville. Probably one of the most career-focused top 20 schools, although I‚Äôm sure people at a lot of schools would say that.

**What kinds of people do you think would love your school?:**

People motivated by status, people that were popular in high school or care about popularity, people who like being well known. Because Vanderbilt is so small, it can feel like everyone in greek life knows everyone else in greek life, which can make Vandy feel a little bit like high school 2.0. It's pretty easy to amass a large network at Vanderbilt, and outgoing people usually have large and vibrant social lives at Vandy. 

Also, people who have a strong knowledge of what they want to pursue after college (Vanderbilt offers incredible resources and mentorship for students, and Vandy is small enough that these resources are accessible to the students who actively seek them out). 

Lastly, people who want to be successful! Vanderbilt grads are leaders in every industry and tend to do very well financially. A lot of my peers are graduating with 6 figure jobs, which is a ton of money at 22 years old.

**What kinds of people do you think would hate your school?:**

People who dislike conformity, or who highly value individual expression. People that care a lot about social justice or political activism or academics - not that Vanderbilt culture counters any of these things, but they don‚Äôt get the conversational air time of greek life or professional recruiting. You can probably find it/create a space for it, but the average Vandy student isn't staying up until 2 discussing the meaning of life or debating philosophy. A lot of people who are at Vanderbilt that hate it really belonged at a small liberal arts college in the Northeast. 

People who get bothered by bubbliness or ""superficial"" happiness, people who are ""artsy"" or ""hipster"" probably won't like the amount of Canada Goose worn on our campus.

Also, people who were looking for SEC-level athletics and fandom are disappointed after attending Vanderbilt. Students usually tailgate and party and skip the game, and our home football games are regularly out-attended by the visiting crowd.

**Do you like your school? Why or why not?:**

I love Vanderbilt. I have 7-8 people from college I love and really care about, and a bunch of casual friends on top of that. 

It‚Äôs a super socially competitive school (probably the most ‚Äúsocial‚Äù of any top 20 school) and at times that can be exhausting. But taking a step back from the imposter syndrome and fatigue that all of that causes, Vanderbilt is pretty amazing. 

90% of my professors were great, I had a lot of adults believe in me and push me to be more successful, I had a ton of opportunities to try and fail and learn, and I met a lot of cool people. 

Especially when it‚Äôs warm out, our campus has a buzz to it that makes you feel like you‚Äôre a part of something special. Vandy, for all its flaws, is great. 

**Your college's biggest strengths. What do students appreciate about their school/take for granted?:**

- Super high concentration of intelligent and socially competent people
- Phenomenal alumni network 
- Mostly great undergraduate professors
- Lot‚Äôs of orgs/opportunities to lead 
- Small enough that you will bump into the same people often enough to maintain a friendship, large enough that you will always have new people to meet and new things on campus to be exposed to 
- I felt like it was the perfect balance of being exposed to Southern culture but attending a progressive university  

**Your college's biggest weaknesses. What do students complain about the most? What would an admissions counselor never tell you?:**

- High concentration of very very large egos
- Definitely an overprogramming issue
- People choose courses/extracurriculars for career ramifications and less from genuine interest
- Culture leans white and wealthy, seems like this is trending down though
- Administration has to balance pleasing convervative board members, alumni, and constituents in Tennessee with liberal student body, largely leans toward student body here but of course students want more
- Incredibly bureaucratic institution for only 6600 undergrads
- Some majors are 2-3x as much work as others (probably true of many colleges)
- The school is going through a serious identity crisis as greek life plays a smaller role and school recruits more talented, diverse students from outside the South

That‚Äôs it, hope this was helpful üòô",2020-09-14 10:00:44,207

I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post in, in that case delete this or perhaps point me in the right direction? :) 

Anyway i have considered getting a degree in ecology / wildlife biology, because i want to work in convervation and do alot of hands on fieldwork and be outdoors. However i absolutely detest what little experience i have with biology labs and courses like cell- and microbiology unfortunately. 

Would you say enjoying these things are a prerequisite for working in these fields?

83,lkpfye,JonnyLew,Family Member Listened to my Chicken Little Forecast,"Hey everyone. So I was talking to my father last week about the maddness happening with GME. We also talked about how the stock market was booming throughout COVID and that it seemed like there was no real reason for it and that a big crash could happen. I knew he had RRSPs and he's 65 and will need that money relatively soon. I told him I was concerned that if a crash happened he could lose a lot of his retirement, having to withdraw it for living expenses while in the crash instead of leaving it all in for the inevitable recovery.

He has about 200+ k in RRSPs, invested pretty convervatively/safely I believe. He hasnt been touching it or monitoring it, just letting it grow over the years.

Anyway, he called me the other day and said he'd withdrawn all of it from his investments and is holding it as CAD dollars for a few months just to see how things shake out.

Keep in mind, neither of us are very knowledgeable about investing. We're both well aware that a crash may never happen (at least not in the forseeable future) and that trying to predict these things is damn near impossible.

Anyway, I'm turning to reddit for advice as I know I dont have much of a clue. What do you guys/gals think of his choice? Is what he is doing dangerous? I'm worried I may have caused him to make a bad decision.

Could the Canadian dollar crash? What are the potential consequences of this decision? Is this actually a safe route to take? Any advice would be really appreciated.",2021-02-15 16:53:29,2

Though I am interested in the town of Alamogordo. Looking though this subreddit it seems pretty dead and when there are comments regarding the town they are usually negative twords the city. The reason I am interested is, because I see so much potential for growth as someone who studies city planning and development. Upon looking at statistics regarding the city, it is anything but growth or even stability. For starters there are plenty of chain restaurants, hardware stores, dealerships, hospital, community college, etc and not to mention it is located fairly close to large cities such as El Paso and Las Cruzes (which are seen as escapes from the city). The city itself has even created a strong semi-thougt out Comprehensive Plan and Redevelopment Plan, so there is no reason (in theory) for a city to be lacking. What is the reason for this, is it the local government? It's convervative views? Poverty/lack of entrepreneurship? What could the city or someone do to improve the city? I get covid is currently happening and might have affected the city significantly, but that should be an incentive to work harder for city growth also it doesn't even have to be growth but stability.

85,kydov6,AlwaysSunnynDEN,Hello Fam: Confessions of a new fan,"TLDR: Never thought much of DC until I started paying attention to it. Nice to meecha!

Hello new family. It feels a little awkward being here, but in a very good way. I promise!¬†
Man, I never thought I‚Äôd be here. I‚Äôve never been into comics. DC, Marvel, independent... Nothing.¬†

I was never a cool guy, but from when and where I grew up, you couldn‚Äôt afford to lose any cool points. Shit, I was in debt. I couldn‚Äôt afford to think outside of the box. It was survival of the toughest. No comics, no D&D, no chance to be yourself.¬†

I never had anything against DC specifically, I just thought very little of comics in general and even less of marquee characters. Everything established had to go, especially anything established and nerdy.

So what did I do? Was I that enlightened dude who went across the grain and learned himself along the way? Ha! You trippin‚Äô. As most repressed people in convervative environments do, I got old enough to move away, never looked back, and got older.

Well what happened? The Doom Patrol happened. In a big way. Larry David brought me to HBO, Doom Patrol brought me to DC. Thanks, Cliff!¬†

I watched both seasons as fast as I could. Something about this show was different than anything I‚Äôve even seen before. I love it. All the characters have such depth. It‚Äôs great.

I had to have more. I was an addict and was itchin‚Äô for that next hit. I found that fix in a little comic store just down the street from my house. I try to think of myself as someone who does the right thing when it matters. In an attempt to live up to my word, I started visiting local small business during a time when a place like that might be in danger. I found a local comic shop and told the owner how much I was into Doom Patrol . That set off both a friendship and an addiction that I've just fallen in love with.

He set me up with the first volume of Doom Patrol silver age. I loved it! Such great characters. It was a little corny, especially towards the latter issues, but this was almost as good as the show... almost. Fast forward about a week, and I‚Äôm upset that there isn‚Äôt a volume 3 published yet.

James, (the owner) and I start talking about all the villains, plotlines, related titles... I‚Äôm obsessed now. Next came the bronze age. Well of course I had to get the omnibus. Financial decisions and all, any grown-up excuse I can think of to sprint further my journey into this world.

Damn! I loved it! I was half way through the darn thing after the first day. Guess who my favorite crossover was? The New Teen Titans. Oh, there‚Äôs another show you say? It‚Äôs also on HBO? It‚Äôs also really good? Are you effing kidding me?

Ok, I‚Äôm hooked. I now stop into the comic shop every few days to hang out, talk comics, and say hello. I‚Äôve been introduced to a whole new world of culture that I was never allowed to participate in when I was younger. I guess I could have if I wasn‚Äôt stressed out and burned out from bullies, jerks, and gen x-ers making my life a living hell.¬†

Therapy, pills, and distance can make a heck of a difference. I‚Äôm so sorry I was never turned on to this world sooner.

I‚Äôm still not really into the major characters that much. I like the stories about the people who also live in this world the most. So far my favorite is Y The Last Man. I‚Äôm on TPB 4 and loving every moment of it. My favorite issues of DP or New Teen Titans are the ones between villains where we get to see the characters be themselves.

What‚Äôs the point of this whole post? There is none. This is just my coming out party. I like what I like. This is good stuff. Got any recommendations? Nice to meecha! Sorry for being so aloof for so long. Self-discovery is a long journey. I‚Äôm happy to be here, really.",2021-01-16 00:26:30,6
86,io0hy4,Jon_S111,ex christian attitudes to Christianity compared to non religious Jewish people's attitude towards Judaism,"So I am Jewish by heritage but an agnostic bordering on atheist by belief, and I always found it interesting how differently atheists and agnostics from Christian backgrounds regard Christianity vs how atheists and agnostics from Jewish backgrounds regard Judaism.  One obvious difference is that atheists and agnostics from Christian backgrounds don't consider themselves Christians for the most part whereas atheist and agnostic Jews consider themselves Jewish.  And I also tend to regard my connection to Judaism as generally a positive whereas most ex Christians seem not to have similar positive feelings towards Christianity.  

One thing that I will say might make a difference is that the attitude among even very traditionalist and theologically conservative Jews towards atheist and agnostic Jews tends to be much more welcoming than convervative Christians are to ex christians or atheists of a Christian background.  For example there are some Jewish rituals that require a ""minyan"" or ten Jewish people, to participate, or if you are Orthodox, ten Jewish men.  So i was once on a plane and some orthodox jews were going around the cabin asking if people were Jewish.  I said I was and they asked me if I could be the tenth for the Minyan.  And i obliged.  To be clear they were not trying to talk me out of being an atheist or trying to get me to become Orthodox, they considered me just as much a Jew as they were and wanted my help to complete a ritual.  Yet if a Christian asked ""would you pray with me"" it carries a totally different connotation.",2020-09-06 23:00:43,8

89,i2jgn8,anewhand,Reformed communities and witnessing,"I'm have my hand in both charismatic and reformed camps. My church is charismatic, almost pentecostal, but we're calvinistic in our soteriology.

I have friends in other charismatic/pentecostal churches whose theology I wouldn't fully agree with, but I'm also friends with many reformed pastors, and am part of a group of guys from mostly reformed churches (some of whom are very different to me) that meets regularly to chat and encourage one another.

I need to be careful about generalising here, but one thing I've noticed from being in both camps is this: my pentecostal friends sometimes say things theologically that make me cringe, but I cannot deny their love for the Lord and their heart to see the unreached won to Christ. Their church services, while shallower in depth, are often contrasted by the challenge for their folks to witness to people close to them, to invite their friends to church, and to be open about their hope and faith in Christ. There's a lot of equipping to go and witness.

From what I've seen from my reformed friends and from visiting their churches, the preaching/teaching is solid with beautiful depth, and the application is more often than not ""trust Christ"", which is wonderful. The contrast here however, is there's rarely a ""go and proclaim the gospel!"", or ""witness to your neighbour"". Any talk of outreach is more often than not something along the lines of ""lets send a missionary to another country!"" (usually to Africa/Asia, where they now have many more Christians than we here in the West do). There's rarely opportunities given by their church to help or enable them to share their faith in their day to day lives.

Now obviously I'm generalising, and a healthy church has to have both, but the results of this poll interested me:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/hz0gie/when\_was\_the\_last\_time\_you\_had\_a\_faith\_based/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/hz0gie/when_was_the_last_time_you_had_a_faith_based/)

As you can see, the majority of people who responded from this community have shared their faith in some way, but it's not a large majority. And by far the biggest single response was ""I can't remember the last time I did anything like that"" - even though there were pre-COVID19 answers included. The question I want to ask, in love, and in as non-judgemental a way as I can manage, is: why?

I mostly listen to reformed preachers/podcasts, and I've noticed again that evangelism often seems like the subject that's talked about least.

I just wanted to know why this seems to be the case (I may be totally off and would love to be corrected), and if it is, wonder if some of us may be missing a call for us as regular believers to be Christ's witnesses in the world around us? Surely it's possible to be rightly focused on being accurate in our doctrine, our sacraments, our confessions, to be theologically convervative but still have a love for Christ that overflows into the world around us?",2020-08-02 15:49:38,7

I would like to understand better this worldview.

They must have known that there were plenty of countries not ruled by European Monarchs, like the Venetian Republic, the Ottoman Empire, Iran, China, Japan and more recently France and the United States, and yet they rejected all these examples while other factions championed them as examples.

92,hootf4,mizjdean,Would an anti-choice Libertarian intrinsically be a hypocrite?,"I have always been curious about this question when I see people who support candidates such as Rand Paul and Ron Paul, in particular. I am not super familiar with Libertarian policies, but my general understanding is that, as an ideological platform, they strongly believe in individual autonomy and the deregulation of human choice by any and all governing bodies. 

While Rand Paul has usually run under the Republican ticket and considers himself a ""conservative libertarian,"" the fact that he opposes all forms of abortion (even in cases of rape and incest) as well as same-sex marriage, in my eyes, is incredibly counterintuitive for a Libertarian (i.e. extreme government intervention and regulation in issues concerning individual self-determination).

I know there are a lot of Libertarians who are pro-choice (such as Dr. Jo Jorgensen), but, I guess my question is, for those of you centrists who support the Pauls for their Libertarian platforms, how do you reconcile their economic plans with their convervative social policies?

Edit: Thanks for your time and answers on this. I suppose I was viewing the Libertarian party through the singular lens of ""freedom of choice,"" which was rather reductive. Given the nuances of these issues, I suppose they can be just as right-wing or left-wing as the next political party.",2020-07-10 08:20:25,11

95,hnuhjz,PopularTradition,Is anywhere in Latin America right for a Left Coast liberal from the USA?,"Hi all,

Curious if there is a place in Latin America for someone like me. I am sure there may be a need. But I also would like to be around like-minded people.

I was raised in a somewhat wealthy conservative Catholic in a Filipino-American household. Went to Catholic school from grades K-12. Then a Jesuit private college in the US. Dual citizen - US/PH. Had the privledge of living in the PH from ages 8-10 then never went back. I write this because I can relate to Latinos on a lot of notes. We were both colonies of Spain that took up Catholicism en masse. 

I was born and mostly raised in Seattle. I had my first large solo journey throughout the US and Canada. COVID has me in Western Mexico right now. Solo travel really opened my eyes. 

Living in Mexico now has made me realized how Left Coast some of my values are. And how much I have changed (not making a value judgement on conservative or progressive values) from initial raising. And how conservative Latin America (again I know you can count Mexico as part of North America) really is.

Left Coast Values that I get down with:

1. Intellectualism
2. Idealism
3. Anti-corruption and bribes (I know this will get me in a lot of LA countries).
4. Culture of individual fulfillment
5. Good government
6. Social reform with a commitment to individiual self/exploration and discovery.
7. Strong environmentalist.
8. Big tech guy having worked for Amazon and Microsoft in the past in corproate.
9. Support LGBTQIA rights. Not super loud about it.
10. Black Lives Matter Supporter - I am pretty loud about this.
11. Spiritual, but not religious, but still identitfies as a Catholic.
12. Racial equality.
13. I renounced drugs and alcohol (which places me way on the convervative end for most people).

What I notice about Mexico that I can get down with (this also overlaps with other parts of LA):

1. Excellent and complex food - I enjoy how moles can be mildly spicy. Straight up the prep time in some of these dishes surpass the Japanese and French.
2. Most biodiverse nation in Latin America. Beautiful nature.
3. Sunny (but damn that humidity though).
4. Rich traditions.
5. Spanish colonial architecture.
6. Loving all the tropical fruits.
7. The Mexican identity is strong as a whole. Not sure about the rest of LA.
8. Quickly industrializing - better roads at least in Jalisco and I know the majority of Mexico's economy went from oil to machinery and transport. (not tech innovation sadly).
9. Economy is set to be the 5th or 7th largest in the world by GDP in 2050.
10. Lots of basketball courts in Jalisco and Nayarit. I am told it is because they are easier to maintain that soccer fields. COVID aside, I do not see sports as being too big in Puerto Vallarta. But a tourist city tends to align with the US which is their largest tourist base.
11. Deep history with lots of different cultures contributing to what is Mexican culture today (mostly the Spanish then indigenous, but the French had a surprisngly big influence on Mexican baked goods).
12. More relaxed pace of life.
13. Warm, friendly culture when you do break past barriers (in my case too many).

What I do not get down with:

1. Lack of diversity of thought - Not many subcultures. I know Mexicans go from white to Afro-Mexican. I know most of the tourist are from the USA (mostly white) or Europe (same). However, within Mexico itself, the diversity of thought seems to be lacking. Maybe I am just not meeting enough progresssive Mexicans. But the majority of LA seems more conservative than the Deep South of the USA. And I spent 7 months in the Deep South during Trump's presidency.
2. Smoke and pollution from old gas guzzling cars.
3. Internalized Oppression/Racism/Colonial Mentality - I notice a lot of Latinos favor white people. Hell Uruguay is 88% white. Argentina's government has documented efforts of trying to whiten the population. Many Latinos in the USA say they are white. Example - I met a Mexican national from D.F. in L.A., USA who told me he dreamed of being white. He had a white girlfriend (while married to his Mexican wife from the puebla he knocked up in his 20's....) then died his hair blonde. He felt like he was on top of the world. He made a tough decision to let her go because he had a daughter to raise. It was sad hearing that story, but he did not see anything wrong with it. Other examples
   1. My white family members get encouraged/rewarded to speak even the smallest amounts of Spanish. I am not fluent, but way better than them. However, I am not white. So the expectations are high for me. I see this play out all the time. It is actually rough to learn Spanish in Latin America if you are not white and perceived to be Latino.
   2. My white grandpa paid in a seperate line in the grocery. After I paid and tipped the bagger at Mega I was accused of stealing the swim trunks by a manager there. This was my second month in Mexico so I did not fully understand what she said.
   3. My father's construciton workers do not like taking pay from me. They perceive me as nonwhite. It could be age too. But they have no problems with my white aunts, grandfather or father. And only my dad speaks Spanish fluently. I am 2nd best in the family.
   4. A manager on my dad's construction project always spoke Spanish to me. I was happy because he never switched out of it. I thought he was being supportive. He later went outside the glass door, wished me well, closed it, then proceeded to talk mad smack about me in Spanish about how I am in Mexico speak perfect Spanish (I never switched to English talking with him). I realized the dude was a old-school Mexican nationalist. I asked the designer who was in the conversation about what I had heard. She admitted in writing what I heard was true. Here is the contrast. My white grandfather who cannot conjugate in the present tense in Spanish was invited to this man's wedding. My father claims that he speaks Spainglish with my grandfather. They have known each other for 30 years. What is the difference? Well my grandfather was in his 60's when they met so he has age. But I low key think perceived skin color was the bigger deal. How else could my grandfather marry a Mexican diplomat who was also a Spanish teacher and never learn Spanish?
   5. Large disparities on how I am treated and how my white cousins, aunts and uncles are treated.
   6. French being the 2nd most learned language after English in Mexico. Like how many Mexicans are really going to France or Quebec to work or live long term? Seems to be romantisizing the oppressor as more sophisticated to me.
   7. I live on a golf course so I am constantly getting Mexican security called on me for walking around when dark by other white residents. One security guard followed me from Par 18 to my house until I opened the door with a key proving I live here. He backed off. We do get robberies. A golf course is an overwhelmingly rich, white space. However, the guards lack discernment. I low key switch to English to let them know I am not some local trying to steal even though I know they do not speak English. This can fit in with Small Mindedness below.
   8. A Mexican national near my age born and racist in PV told me I hated white people from bringing up social justice issues. This was after he told me about his racist treatement in Australia/New Zealand.
4. Small Mindedness in many places
   1. The amount of times I have had folks just stare at me in pueblos (Jala, Compostela, Sayulita, Boca de Tomatlan, etc) amazes me. I waive and smile, but do not get the same. This happens in PV too sometimes.
   2. Even at Costco in Puerto Vallarta. They ask me for my passport then mug it like I am not supposed to be able to afford what I am buying.
   3. Other than the fact that over 10% of Mexico's population is in the USA, I do not get the sense that you all as a country do not travel much. I think Latin America may be the same. 120 million US citizens have never been out of the country according to a 2020 Superbowl ad. I believe it. The problem is that this leads to ignorance and misconceptions about other races (not all Asians are Chinos).
5. Cartel and Crime rates in some places bother me. But I am also not seen as white, drive a shit car, and realize this could potentially save me from being a target.
6. PEMEX is a huge environmental transgressor. Recycling is unheard of from what I have seen. Brasil's Bolsonaro is not that much better cutting down half the Amazon while no one is looking. In 2018, Mexico opened up the market for private competition. I am finally seeing other gas stations other than PEMEX. But if that is the big innovation with environmentalism then Mexico (and perhaps the rest of LA let me know) has a long way to go).
7. Inefficiencies - not sure if it is like this in the rest of Latin America, but I can fill my own gas. I do not need someone checking. I had some Internet guys come over. They sent three guys. Reminds me of the Philippines. Labor is cheap and people want to work so overstaff. It just seems inefficient after working in corporate America.
8. Little talk of Social Justice. AMLO denies women's domestic abuse calls. No one wants to talk about how indigenous Mexicans are treated and underrepresented in the media. Etc. I know this is the same for the majority in LA.
9. Tip culture - the tip culture at grocery stores and gas stations make me uncomfortable. Tipping is an offshoot of European aristocracy. Emilio Zapata (Play of Ayala) and (to an extend) Pancho Villa fought against classisism in the decade long Mexican Revolution. Mexico has struggled with classicism for a long time.
10. Rigid ideas on what guys should like and what girls should like. I am sure this may change in larger cities like Guadalajara. But that city is also super segregated, racist, and has a lot of cartel killings.  [https://territorio.mx/el-parque-de-las-gatas-racismo-en-guadalajara/](https://territorio.mx/el-parque-de-las-gatas-racismo-en-guadalajara/)
11. Lots of downplaying of COVID or straight attacking some nurses in some areas of Mexico.
12. I have encountered some anti-American sentiments. Makes sense. Trump is a douche. But then again it could be linguistic discrimination or skin tone discrimination.

You know...the fact that I think I could go on means maybe Latin America is not right for me. Shoots let me know if there are some progressive strongholds anywhere. I doubt it. Maybe I should stick to Europe and the Left Coast of the USA.",2020-07-08 21:01:21,0
96,gbkxsr,andre300000,I just watched Yuri Bezmenov (former kgb) Psychological Warfare Subversion & Control of Western Society and... wow.,"Hi all, I just watched this lecture about the Soviet-era subversion of the West: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZnkULuWFDg

Full disclosure, I am Canadian. I watched this video because I have an interest in furthering my understanding of the world. I am making this post to gather some perspective, specifically from Americans. Please don't attack me for taking a ""devil's advocate"" approach, I only wish to learn.

TLDR: This lecture states that movements of peace, worker's rights, women's rights, gay rights, arts and humanities are the result of Soviet propaganda. Believing this, many Americans will work against their own interests. I understand globalism can be a threat, but I am not convinced that American conservatism is the remedy.

I have a few concerns

1. The lecturer is a ""Soviet defector"". How can anyone be sure that this isn't a continuation of the same propaganda? This man seems like an agent injecting the idea that policies resulting in higher quality of life = soviet propaganda, therefore any real American should resist this. Specifically, I am talking about higher wages and collective bargaining. He is suggesting that Americans should surrender to the corporate machine because you are lucky enough to be an expendable worker.

2. Once again, this man equates policies that result in higher quality of life to ""demoralization"". Gay rights, feminism, sexual liberties and studying the arts and humanities. Of course, these movements have been hijacked to some degree. But denying their importance is denying dignity to huge populations of humans who don't deserve to be oppressed. Also denies the complex reality of the human being. There is not freedom in America if self-expression is policed and stigmatized by the church or the state, even with the goal of homogeny.

3. Why is homogeny desired by so many American convervatives? Can tight-knit communities exist in a diverse culture?

3. The American conservative view of ""morality"". To me, it is arbitrary. Many claim that society is degenerating because people are use their freedom to deviate from the ""moral code"" which is ancient and arbitrary. Are progressives really degenerates, or are conservatives just prudes?

5. Many people suffer under American conservative policies and culture. What makes clinging to American conservatism more desirable than progressive changes that increase quality of life for vulnerable populations? What is the argument against gay rights and women's rights?

3. I've often seen people in this sub cry ""NPC"" or ""brainwashed"" towards everyone who disagrees with them. This is a rational cop-out and denies the humanity and liberty of many. Can you do this while claiming your culture's moral superiority?

2. What makes Americans so sure of Christianity? Disclaimer, I was raised Catholic and have great respect for the bible. I've extensively studied Christianity and other religions. I see the value in having a spiritual framework but I believe that it is a philosophical cop-out to subscribe to any of the ""big"" religions, which were undeniably meticulously designed by humans and have been historically used for population control. 

3. This man ends the video by suggesting that civilizations should return to religion. Again, I see this as a means to radicalize and reaffirm conservatives. Many times, I've seen ""America vs EVIL FORCES"".  Of course, a civilization that is homogenous, sterile and adherent might not degenerate into civil war. But is that civilization truly free?

3. The strongest argument in favour of religion is COMMUNITY and FAMILY. It's extremely important, universally. Especially within American values. What makes dogmatic religious ideologies inherently more desirable than secular spiritual frameworks i.e. the psychedelic movement? (Moral degeneration is not an answer because that is relative and subjective)

A list of answers that will be counterproductive (and that I've heard before)

- You're brainwashed
- You're an NPC
- Canuks are cucked
- Comments that let your superiority complex leak
- References to my post history
- Unrelated complaint
- The greatest trick the devil played is convincing us he doesn't exist

Thanks for entertaining me!",2020-05-01 11:09:07,32

98,akn1j6,ja74dsf2,Questions about Brexit from a very confused Dutchman,"Hi /r/UnitedKingdom!

I'm from the Netherlands and I am thoroughly confused about the state of Brexit and the UK in general. Brexit seems like the most important moment for the UK in my lifetime and though I feel like I'm reading quite a lot about it, it's a lot of day-to-day stuff and I've lost sight of the bigger picture.

My questions:

1. **What social groups are in favour of (a no-deal) Brexit? And which politicians are in favour of it?** I know the political landscapes of the UK and the Netherlands are different, but there is only one Dutch far-right party in favour of leaving the EU and they ""only"" have 13% of the seats in parliament. It's actually a lot, but nowhere near enough. They're also really right-wing, basically UKIP-esque, and their positions are generally not taken very seriously in parliament (though various parties have become more right-wing to get back votes from them).

2. **What do supporters claim the benefits of (a no-deal) Brexit are?** Are their arguments based on anything? If not, who is giving them a platform to speak? I know of the Sun and other tabloids, but isn't it quite well known now that the leave campaign spread a lot of misinformation? Did that not completely invalidate them as a source of information?

3. **What is the Labour party's position on Brexit? And Corbyn specifically?** The Dutch Labour Party is very pro-EU. The Socialist Party is skeptical, but mostly because they see the EU as a neo-liberal project that creates social inequality. But they obviously see that the EU has brought peace and prosperity and argue for transforming the EU rather than leaving it. I keep reading about Corbyn being in favour of Brexit, but I don't understand his ideological basis for it.

4. I have the **same question for the Conservatives**. The Netherlands doesn't really have a convervative party like the Tories, but basically all our right-wing parties are pro-business, free trade, etc. Some of the biggest proponents of the EU are the two big liberal parties (the biggest and third biggest party in parliament). Together, they have a third of all the seats. I know about the Lib Dems, but surely the ideas of free trade and an open economy resonate with a lot of Conservatives voters and politicians too? Who are they and why aren't they speaking out against Brexit?

5. **How likely is a no-deal Brexit?** As an outsider, I just don't see how it can logically happen. It seems like everyone can see that a no-deal Brexit would be horrendous. Even if (and I hope I'm being generous) 20% of the country think it's the right course of action, that's still 80% of the country that don't want a no-deal Brexit. What are the forces pushing for what a relatively small minority wants? How come they have so much power?

6. **Why do I keep reading about continued negotiations with the EU, especially about the backstop?** This article from the BBC, for example: [
Brexit: May urged to secure backstop concessions from EU](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47024450). Surely the EU's position is obvious by now? This seems like a massive waste of time. The same goes for earlier when the UK wanted to keep free trade but not have freedom of movement. From July 2017: [
Brexit: British officials drop 'cake and eat it' approach to negotiations](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/02/british-officials-drop-cake-and-eat-it-approach-to-brexit-negotiations). This must have been discussed in parliament. But when it was suggested, surely the immediate response from the overwhelming majority would have been: ""what the fuck are you talking about, that will never work, do you not understand how the EU works?"". I fail to understand the British negotiation tactics and I think most people in the rest of the EU feel the same way.

7. Last one, about the referendum itself: **wasn't it a non-binding referendum? Who made the decision to actually go through with Brexit?** I thought Theresa May was against Brexit? And this ties to questions 3 and 4 I guess, but didn't/don't the Remain group have a majority in parliament? It seems insane to me that this whole thing is happening because of a massively flawed, *non-binding* referendum that sidesteps the position of parliament. There was a non-binding referendum in the Netherlands just 3 months before the Brexit one. It was about an agreement between the EU and Ukraine. The ""no"" campaign was spreading tons of misinformation, turnout was low, and most people who voted no did so as a protest vote against the government rather than really being against the agreement (most people didn't really understand it). This sounds *exactly* like Brexit. However, the Dutch government decided to essentially ignore the referendum and the agreement was signed a year later. Has anyone heard of this referendum? I think it could have been a useful lesson ahead of the Brexit vote.

I appreciate any and all insights!",2019-01-28 06:39:24,101

This sub is extremely biased though and it's becoming a problem, and I'm saying this as a leftist.

When it was Sanders vs Biden, major news of Biden winning important states wasn't even upvoted to the top. Now: Legitimate criticism on Biden, Obama and most other democrats is downvoted now. And while it's obvious that the GOP tries to rig this election, the democrats aren't saints themselves. But bad news about the democrats is downvoted even when it's reported by good sources.  Like: Why doesn't the news of the democratic party suing to get the green party of the ballot get to the top?

This sub is hating Trump so much that it has the risk of going full cult of Biden. And what if Biden wins, what are 'we' going to do on /r/politics? Keep endlessly cheering for a president without critique? Are 'we' keep going to comment 'you must be a convervative or russian troll' on everyone criticizing the potential biden administration?

101,epc7vt,AHungryWombat,The pain of existence is unbearable.,"&#x200B;

I need to share my story and relieve myself of this burden, or I'll drown in my sorrow.  I never ever do things like this, and I don't even know if anyone will ever read this or care.  It doesn't matter; I just need to do this.  This is my story; every single word I write here is true as Jesus Christ lives.  God help me, I could use some prayer right now in my life.

&#x200B;

I am 32.  I was raised in a Christian home by two great parents who took their faith seriously and who raised me in the nurture and admonition of the Lord from a very early age.  I have an excellent memory which goes back to the age of one and a half and I vividly remember praying to Jesus to forgive my sins at about the age of three.  I took that prayer seriously and have tried to please God all my life.  I have always had a sense of heavy purpose hanging over me.  I do think now that there were things I did not fully understand about the Christian faith at that young age; for example, a child can hardly grasp the concept of relinquishing one's own life and purposes in favor of following the example set forth by our Lord and Savior.  I do see, looking back now, a legalism pervading my life and service in my youth and young adulthood.  I don't think now that I was truly born again at the age of three, but I do believe that I have been being drawn by God my whole life.

&#x200B;

My adult life has always been marked by spiritual struggle, suffering, depression, isolation from my peers, and health issues.  My mother would always tell me, ""You aren't an island, J,"" but my fervent desire to please God with my life never made me popular with my peers as a young man.  Even in a Christian high school and my (mostly spiritually dead, at least in terms of young people) home church growing up, I never really fit in.  In my early twenties, I had a time of falling away from God.  I was going to a secular univerity, and felt completely alone.  My sister had moved out of state, and aside from her, the young adult age group at my church was two other guys who were obvious about the fact that they could not care less about the Christian faith.  The few Christian friends that I had in middle school and early high school had long since moved away.  I tried to get involved with a Bible study on the campus of the secular university where I went to school.  The Bible study was seemingly convervative, King James Bible only, in fact, and seemed like a great possibility for making some Christian friends for the first time in years.  Then I found out that the group was the cult called ""University Bible Fellowship,"" begun in Asia by some Reverend Moon or other and which cult took root in the United States.  The group would recruit on college campuses, generally targeting young men with bright futures, and then the cult would begin the manipulation of their members' lives.  Arranged marriages to Asian women for the purposes of citizenship and further control were part of the group's modus operandii, and members were manipulated into signing houses, vehicles, and property to the group, or to donate large sums of money.  The group was emotionally manipulative, and in some cases physically, psychologically, or even sexually abusive.  Fortunately I found all this out before becoming too entangled with the cult, but I became incredibly bitter against God.  It seemed that at every turn, I dealt with Him in good faith and sought Him while He toyed with me.

&#x200B;

I was crushed by the experience. I tried counseling with the pastor of my then-new church (I changed church membership for a church with a larger active group of young people) but it was difficult and in despair I finally told the man that I felt God could care less about me, that my life was utterly meaningless, and that I had no desire to put any effort into my faith any longer.  Desperate for a new start in my life, I worked overtime for half a decade saving money with the intention of traveling overseas for work.  Ultimately that path was closed to me, but I eventually moved to another state far away where I began a promising career in a busy call center.  During these years I was not seeking God's face but still felt His constant pull in my life, an influence I tried to ignore.  Being an industrious and ambitious young man, I poured myself into my work, which occupied all of my time and energy.  I finally could have a real future on my own terms if I worked hard enough for it.

&#x200B;

About five years ago, I was living and working in that state and thought I had my life all planned out.  Then I began having serious debilitating health issues.  I had digestive trouble for months, which left me weak and often sick, sick enough that I was missing work days, sometimes every week.  I had heart palpitations and the intense debilitating migraine headaches which have plagued me my whole life got worse, and often presented with chest aura in addition to the usual 8-14 hours of visual distortion, nausea, and uncontrollable vomiting.  I was in the hospital several times in 2016, on one occasion thinking I was about to have a massive heart attack.  One ER nurse, after looking at my tachycardia which just wasn't stopping, shook her head and said to me, ""You are just too young for this.""  But there were never any answers or solid reasons for the things I was experiencing.  I began seeing doctors, but there were nothing but dead ends.  Finally I was missing one or two days every week and just couldn't keep doing the job.  I resigned in order to rest and try to focus on diet and health.  I was completely alone for most of the last six months of 2016.

&#x200B;

I had a sense that God was reaching for me.  I absolutely did not want to listen to His voice or influence.  My savings were being sucked away by living expenses and bills.  Medical debts were building up.  I don't recall the total amounts that I owed from my ER visits but being uninsured they were well into five figures and beyond my capability to pay them.  I began selling possessions to pay the rent and keep a roof over my head.  I began looking for part time work which was not physically rigorous and applied for job after job.  Nothing worked out.  Finally, two days before Thanksgiving I was hit by an excruciatingly painful bacterial infection out of the blue.  I was in such agony that I could barely walk and went to the ER again.  I was told that a clump of some bacterial growth was putting pressure on sensitive nerves.  I was in the hospital all afternoon and evening that day, alone, in agony, and completely afraid.  The world seemed completely dark and I was consumed by anger and bitterness.  Finally, late in the evening, on my hospital bed, I told God that I could not fight Him any longer. I begged Him to forgive my wickedness and rebellion and rejection of Him and told Him that my life was His.

&#x200B;

I've never felt such relief.  I was still alone and in pain, but all the anger and bitterness and fear just disappeared instantly.  My pain began to lessen, and after some time I could walk again without being in agony.  I was giving prescriptions for antibiotics and painkillers and sent home, but by the time I got home the pain was gone and I never filled that painkiller prescription.  But what now?  My life was a ruin, everything was gone: my job, my savings, my health, the people I once had in my life, and I was buried under a mountain of medical bills.  I began to seek God's face and tried to determine whether I should stay where I was or move back home.  Finally, I realized I needed to ask my parents for help and go home, so I did.

&#x200B;

I wish I could say that everything was great and I lived happily ever after, but it just isn't so.  In fact, my life since then has been brutally difficult and full of troubles.  My mother told me once that she felt Satan was trying to swallow me whole.  Maybe she was right.

&#x200B;

My health was still a tremendous problem.  I saw doctors and specialists for over a year with no answers.  One doctor told me she thought my health issues were all in my head and that if I would just go outside for a walk every day it would all get better.  Except that things were a rollercoaster; a mere few months before, I WAS going out for walks every day but at that point lacked the strength to do so.  Some days I lacked the strength to even move out of my bed much.  I lost the ability to eat my favorite kind of foods; my health issues triggered an intolerance to gluten and eating it would trigger more migraines.  It just wasn't worth the risk to eat glutenous breads any longer.  Eating became a joyless chore and my sense of taste and smell were largely gone anyways.  I reached the point where I was tired of seeing all the doctors telling me I was crazy.  I wanted to give up on finding answers.  My mother (bless her) set up an appointment with an unusual physician who specializes in blood-borne illness and Lyme disease, and dragged me out to see her.  After lots of very detailed blood tests, some answers began to appear; I had a very rare foodborne bacterial infection called brucellosis, which is contracted by eating contaminated dairy products.  I likely picked up this disease during a missions trip to rural Brazil in my mid-teens.  I am extremely fortunate to be alive, I suppose; apparently when brucellosis is present in the blood stream for long periods of time, it can settle in the heart valves and really mess you up.  My cardiologist says this didn't happen in my case though.  I also have Lyme disease, which was not diagnosed whenever I contracted it and which had gone untreated for probably years.  An overgrowth of a very antibiotic resistant strain of pneumonia had also made itself at home in my nasal sinuses, causing my loss of taste and smell.  There are doubtless other things going on too.  The brucellosis cleared itself up after eight hellish months of heavy-duty antibiotics.  I was on five or six different prescriptions on a rotating basis, all of which had that little side effect of ""depression"" -- and I was depressed out of my mind already after years of chronic illness.  I tried to overdose on painkillers during these years of medical misery, but for some reason I miraculously woke up the next morning with no negative side effects whatsoever.  I still blow bloody, wormy chunks out of my sinuses almost every morning in the shower.  I still have nasty pustules erupting all over my arms and back and scalp.  These are getting somewhat better.  The tremors, muscular weakness, and palpitations are mostly gone.  The migraines are getting better too.  Maybe one day I'll be healthy again.

&#x200B;

My prospects for the future are pretty bad though.  I haven't been able to work through a lot of this.  I'm living at home with my parents, feeling like a worthless parasite.  I did go back to work at a fast food place where I worked years before; at least I have made enough progress physically to be mostly functional as an employee.  The money I make is barely enough to cover my growing vehicle expenses from my increasingly dilapidated 2002 car.  So yeah, it's been a little bit hard these last few years.

&#x200B;

I haven't even gotten to the good part yet though.  Funny, isn't it?  Since the beginning of Creation, no creature has ever had a greater capacity for causing misery than the Woman.  All the difficulties I've experienced, all the pain and physical misery, and it's all a drop in the bucket compared to this.  I first met V seven years ago, at church.  It wasn't love at first sight, but I knew immediately that she was special and that I would never meet anyone like her.  I guess that realization made her interesting to me.  You have to understand, I have only ever loved this one woman, in my entire life.  I have never been in a relationship.  I have never had sex.  It definitely wasn't love at first sight or any such nonsense though.  After that first meeting at church, I just always noticed this young lady; we were always in the same circles: church, Sunday school, youth group activites, and her brother married my little sister about five years ago also, and our families are close.  About three years ago, I realized that I had strong feelings for V, and I asked her our.  She rejected me completely and instead began seeing another fellow who asked her out about the same time.

&#x200B;

I guess this was my great test. God rubbed the whole situation in my face for three years.  Family events, church, and for a whole year this girl was literally the girl next door as my family moved into a rented house in her neighborhood during a time of transition.  That was an awful year.  I was so sick, and one of my few pleasures (I often couldn't even afford to pay for gas in order to go anywhere) was walking a short way to a pond in the neighborhood.  But then V and her boyfriend began frequenting the same spot.  One of the few spiritually-minded friends I had during this time was another of V's brothers.  I just couldn't escape the situation.  Add to the mix the fact that for years, V's father and mother didn't approve of their relationship, that he intended to tell her to break it off but the pastor of the church very much approved of this young man, that the young man himself (by his own admission!) felt that God didn't want him to date V but he wanted to do so anyways.  It was a tempestuous and volatile situation where it was never certain if V's relationship with the fellow would last (she had been engaged twice before and those relationships did not work out).  People I respected told me to wait and see, to keep praying, not to run, no, keep going to church even though it makes you wish you could die seeing them together all the time, everywhere.  I did pray, for years.  I did hope, for years.  I did keep going to that church.  I should have run and found another church family, but I didn't.

&#x200B;

V's family is very popular in that church.  She married this other fellow at the beginning of this year.  They are going to make him a pastor at that church.  My mother and sister planned her wedding.  Words cannot describe the intense agony that I have been bearing of late.  Over the years, years of watching, praying, hoping, my joy and will to live have slowly been sucked away.  I feel completely crushed.  To be honest, I have also, in the midst of all this woe and physical misery, been praying that God will have mercy on me and just take my life.

&#x200B;

I am at the nadir of my existence.  What was the point of these thirty-two years?  My apartment's worth of junk is boxed up in my current bedroom's worth of space.  I have no real assets to speak of.  I have no fancy degrees or a promising career ahead of me.  There is no one in my life that I can speak to about all these things; my father is emotionally distant and vaguely disapproving and just wants me out as soon as possible; my mother and sister are pretending they don't see my pain.  I have no real friends to speak of.  I haven't been to my home church in over a year, where all my family members attend, because when I am there my suffering poisons my worship and ability to pay attention to the Word.  Death looks so pleasant to me now.  ""Curse God and die""?  My daily temptation.  I feel like such a false Christian too; surrounded by my unsaved coworkers, how can I be a testimony?  What is there to see in my life that would make Christ attractive to anyone?  ""Yield to Christ and suffer worse than you have ever suffered before""?  How could I possibly share my faith when this is my true and honest experience?  My soul is screaming in agony inside me.  I break into tears without warning.  My grief is constant.  When I think of the things Jesus has allowed in my life, I am sickened and blackness threatens to swallow me alive.  The things that God has done to me, I wouldn't do to my own worst enemy.  I am a kind and compassionate person.  I treat everyone as I would wish to be treated.  I always do my best at work.  I get up in the morning, day after day, wishing I could die, but I keep on going, and then I go to bed at night and still wish I could die.  When, Lord Jesus?  When will you finally grant me the mercy of death, so I can see your face and finally, finally be somewhere I belong?

&#x200B;

I know this is my test; I know God wants me to justify Himself and not me.  After I watched the woman I love marry another man, I wrote this:

&#x200B;

INVICTUS

&#x200B;

At the nadir of my life,

Despair intent to swallow whole,

I watched another take to wife

The one I love with all my soul.

&#x200B;

Tempted thus to raise my fist,

To curse the Author of my fate,

By some grace I here resist;

Instead I bow and contemplate.

&#x200B;

At that Cross of wrath and tears

Where Christ all my sins once paid,

Felt He these same pains and fears

While His life He freely laid?

&#x200B;

Though the way is hard and strait,

Though the billows ceaseless roll,

I shall bow and yield my fate

To the Captain of my soul.

&#x200B;

I have always, always justified God in the face of others.  I have held my tongue before others when I am tempted to pour out my grievances.  Like Asaph, I know if I speak, I will only cause harm.  Like Job, I am determined not to sin with my lips.  But I am dying inside.  As I write this, I am just sobbing uncontrollably.  When, when will all this misery be over?  What do I have to do to be free of this?  What can I do with all these worthless feelings?  The pain of existence is crushing me.

&#x200B;

Lord Jesus Christ, You promised that we would not be tempted above what we can withstand!  You promised that you wouldn't break a bruised reed!  You promised that when Your children beg You for bread or fish or an egg that You would not be unjust to give a snake or scorpion or rock.  You said in Your Word that it is a fitting thing for a laborer to be requited for their labors.  But all these words seem to ring hollow to me now.  Where are You?  All my experience screams in my ears and puts the lie to all these sayings.

&#x200B;

God have mercy on me and just let me die.",2020-01-15 19:44:22,35
102,6002hl,inibrius,I don't have to be nice.,"So this was just fun.  

At lunch a few minutes ago, had to run by a local sporting goods store.  (Apparently every new sport my kid does requires new clothes and accessories).  So I'm perusing volleyball kneepads (who even knew that was a thing for 9 year olds) got my phone googling to figure out what size I need, and this woman walks up next to me, snorts, and says 'well that's not very professional'.  I ignored her, as in this area there's a thing called the 'Seattle freeze' where we don't talk to random people in stores, as they might either be a. crazy, or b. want to start a conversation with you.  

Well she proceeds to stick her hand in front of my phone screen and say 'didn't you hear what I said?'  I looked up, and big surprise, middle aged woman, wearing spandex that's screaming 'ow ow ow stop I give up', a $200 workout jacket over it, and a foul look on her face.  Said 'please don't do that.  What do you want anyway?'  

She starts in about my outfit, and how unprofessional it is.  In honor of St Patty and him hating snek, I'm wearing a green flannel shirt, a t-shirt with shamrocks that says 'converve water drink beer' on it, jeans, and a hat with a green triforce on it.  I look down and say 'ok, but who cares?  My boss doesn't give a shit, so why does it matter?  You should really mind your business.'  And I look back at my phone trying to understand why a 4'6"" kid wears a medium but a 4'7"" kid wears a small.  She puts her hand on my phone and tries to knock it out of my hands.  

""Lady, I appreciate your concern, but I'm really not interested in your opinion.  Now get your hands the fuck off of me before you lose them."" 

Well she shrieks.  ""WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?  YOU CAN""T TALK TO ME THAT WAY! GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOWWWWWW!""

At that point I got where she was coming from, and quickly said 'ah.  I see your problem.  I don't work here.'  Well she's beyond listening.  She's got a whole rant going.  

Store manager comes up to see what's going on, I totally ignore her and before she can say anything ask 'hey bro, do you know anything about kids volleyball pads?  I'm lost here, and this chick freaking out isn't helping.'  

You could literally watch the gears in her head churn.  She finally realized that I didn't work there, and turned purple in the face.  Wasn't even red.  PURPLE.  Thought she was gonna die.  I asked 'lady, you ok?'  She squeeked and ran out of the store.

Told the manager what happened, he laughed.  Gave me 10% off.  ",2017-03-17 15:26:19,2047
103,im4ova,wonderingstuff_123,"Random rant CW:Biological children, mention of forms of abuse (Also all triggers marked as spoiler)","So, I am not sure where to begin. I found out that I might be trans when I was 13, now I'm about to turn 15. I came out once, but for some reason it made me feel really depressive to be out so I said that it was just a phase and I no longer think so, and the subject was done, since my mother was supportive. Mostly it was just some irrational fear of change and stuff, but some fear was because of my father who's very supportive in some things, in some others he's the definition of conservative. He also severly overreacts, nearly destroyinge from small things furniture and other items. He never attacks me or my mother physically, though, and his overreactions are more like toddler tantrums. But he's racist often and doesn't understand a whole lot of some social things, which would probably include any LGBT stuff. So I had to wonder if he'd accept it, but I doubt he'd stop loving me really. My mother was fully supportive and said she doesn't care how I turn out, but she was shocked which also made me sick, for some reason. I guess I felt responsible for changing what they're used to.

CW:Abuse mention

>!What is also a big problem is my shitty worthless asshole manipulative sociopath friend who has engineered my easily brainwashed brain in primary school for me to subconsciously always feel lots of empathy and liking for him, no matter what happens, and now I have a sort of subconscious version of stockholm syndrome, I just can't leave him without getting a horrible decrease in mental health. And basically, problem is: he has his standards for how somebody should be, and if anyone deviates, he hates them and finds them stupid and cringy, and when I fall into such a different category he harrasses me until I no longer do. And I doubt he likes transgender people, he'd probably say that they wouldn't need to and yadda yadda. I doubt he has the capacity of feeling empathy, and I think his mother is affected by him as well, and everyone else he doesn't know personally he just manipulates to make him look like a really nice, normal person. Would be nice if he just got scared of my knowledge of how to produce toxic chemicals, or if he fell into a coma, or if he needs to leave the area/town/city/state/country/continent/planet. I hate him. He already had many in my position, they all left him. He told me they're all assholes and that they have done horrible things, etc. I doubt it. One I knew personally and he kept stuttering and I think the asshole might have been the reason he did, I nearly started because of him as well. And he's caused lasting phobias and all that fun stuff. I wish I could beat him like the pile of shit he is some time. I'm done with this topic now.!<

School is a problem. No classmates or other people would likely be supportive, they don't even have an idea that LGBT+ is really a thing. Teachers are strange and convervative and can't even teach properly, some don't even make an attempt to be nice, so nope, don't wanna be a non-passing trans girl there. And since I live in Germany, you have to go to school, home schooling is only an option if you have severe cancer or something or other diseases where going to school is deadly, and self-schooling without a teacher is something I haven't even believed exists until a few years ago. So, unless you can deal with record levels of dysphoria and hating and manage to protect yourself from people possibly beating you up for fun (how is there so many psycho/sociopaths on this school? Things like this have happened, for no particular reason other than their fun), only then you could survive in my school.

Biological children trigger warning:

>!I also hate how you can't have biological children, at least not that you can bear them and that they can't come from your own uterus. You can, in the following years, maybe even have an uterus implanted and experience a pregnancy and periods by taking immunosupressants for the time you want to have your children through ""your"" uterus, but it's a donor uterus, and you can't even birth normally, you have to get the other way to give birth, the surgery which I forgot the name of. Well, or you cryoconserve your sperm, but unless you turn out lesbian trans, you won't be able to do anything with them, unless of course you use your genetic material to fertilize the donor uterus, but that would be pretty strange and wouldn't include the DNA of your partner. So it's a complicated situation. But if you only care about having a child even if it isn't your biological child, then it's a perfect solution, except for that you can't keep the uterus.!<

Well, now after all that, I wish I could just wear a skirt.. god, I love skirts for some reason. They look so cool. Sadly, I can't order things in secrecy and my home is too small that my parents would notice anything I do. So I gotta imagine. But hopefully not long anymore, but I gotta solve all of those problems first.",2020-09-03 18:24:23,5
104,ivo2bm,GGSee,different stim meds response & supplements,"Wanna share on my experiences with different stim regime and health supplements.

TTC 6 years and started ART from April 2020.
 
April - Menopur + rFSH for 3 days then added Cetrotide on D4 of stim, but somehow I still ovulated earlier than expected and cycle called off.  Thought I almost got an ovarian torsion or something as it was a sudden acute pain over L lower abdomen and I had to curl up on bed the whole day and luckily it resolved after a weekend rest.

May - stopped for a month due to poor asthma control

June - RE put me on Suprecur (Burserelin) nasal spray. Thats sorta work as an agonist protocol, at first stimulating the pituitary to produce FSH/LH for few days then later spray will exhaust the receptors and stop body from making FSH/LH.  Then started stim injection. I used Menopur & rFSH. Ovaries were not too responsive and appeared dormant. AFC only 4-5 but all small according to the cycle day.  But progesterone become too high and uterus out of sync and too advanced in cycle, unlikely to have success in implantation.  IUI was cancelled and told to have sex on my own.  Obviously didnt achieve anything.

July - Similar protocol as of June ie Spray(increase frequency from twice per day to four times) + Menopur/rFSH injection, this time progesterone okay and proceeded to IUI but no success

August - Suprecur nasal spray 12 days & stim injection 10 days (Rekovelle + Luveris) and Saizen was added for the last 8 days of stim; Saizen 1 unit/day; yielded 13 eggs, 6 blasts

September - Suprecur nasal spray 12 days & stim injection 8 days (Rekovelle + Luveris + Saizen), clinic premixes everything together so I just have to do one shot per night. Again Saizen was given at 1 unit/day for 8 days;  yielded 9 eggs

Above are my experiences. I am glad my RE is open to change of protocol or drug choices. She is willing to switch and try out everything instead of asking one to retry similar protocol over and over.

I am not sure if I am biased but I think Saizen (HGH) does help. It doesnt seem to do harm so might as well include it. Another factor is the human derived Rekovelle and Luvaris. I am more responsive to these meds than my previous cycles with hampster derived Menopur and recombinant rFSH.

RE said the human derived stims used to cost more and somehow the companies have a discount for them for recent few months so she switched me to the regime. I think the injection of the human derived stims are less painful then Menopur and rFSH. 

I also take several supplements:

DHEA: 25mg once daily from CD1 then increase to twice daily on CD 8-9 and max out to three times for last few days till egg retrieval

Omega: twice a day of preparation in form of 500EPA/250DHA

Multiple Vit: the special vitamins formulated for ART, included CoQ10,  Inositol, Melatonin 

Tru Niagen: a special form of B3, NAD+, supposed to combat anti-ageing, some small studies in mice showed that it help with the reproductive system

Green Powder: just drink for antioxidant effect assuming that can help ovaries or eggs from oxidative stress

I am desparate and basically put everything in. I dont think those extra HGH or supplements will do any harm. I just hope to boost my ovaries for few months to get the eggs out to bank up. 

I am not so diligent to read up about the details of IVF. I just rely on what my RE decision and listen to her on what to do. Now with first hand experience, hope the info will be useful to some of you. Some REs tend to be convervative and a bit old school. Allowing 3-4 months for RE to work out what the problems lie.  If things dont work out after 3-4 months of IUI or IVF egg retrieval, I think its worthwhile to have more drastic change in terms of medication choice or protocol.  Try raise different ideas with RE. Finally, I know its tiring going in for scans, bloodwork, stims etc. Wanna take rest in between cycle. My RE said the stim meds seem to have additive effect to wake up the ovaries. She usually suggests to do back to back stim to bank up on the eggs/embryos.",2020-09-19 02:29:28,1
105,dl5nbm,secret_tsukasa,"my family is being excluded from my aunt, uncles, and cousin's activities and it is making me depressed.","I haven't told the my nuclear family yet, but my other family is pretty big, they have a lot of grown up sons and daughter in laws.

106,htelfq,FluffyBoner,Is there a sub like /r/unitedkingdom that is not dominated by Labour?,"Hello!  
Is there a sub similar to /r/unitedkingdom but where ""Labour"" is less dominant and it's more equal?  
The rest of this post is mostly a write up of my experience with /r/unitedkingdom and why I chose to post here.  
I often find myself reading /r/worldnews, /r/news, and /r/unitedkingdom, to get different news.  
I also read the reddit comments to get an idea of the general opinion on whatever news topic.  
I find that /r/unitedkingdom looks quite intimidating to post comments in (which is why I'm making this post in /r/TooAfraidToAsk !) the comments seem to be very angry, frustrated, and practically every post has a type of ""Fuck Boris"" comment. I get it, practically the entire sub hates Boris, yet when I see someone with a different opinion, people argue very dismissively (it's not like either side teaches each other anything), and most of the time I don't come out of the comment chain thinking ""Oh I get it, yeah fuck Boris"". Overall it does come off as a place to vent, and not a place to discuss a variety of views people have. There's generally no sense of unity or productive conversation. As /r/unitedkingdom is such a staple sub, if ANY party was the overwhelming majority and others get silenced and harsh comments thrown at them, then what's the point, it's not unitedkingdom, its just labour, or convervative. 
The only times I see people agree on a different view is when people frame their comment like ""I fucking hate Boris with my soul, but with this specific thing, he finally has done something slightly right for once, but fuck him still.""
Generally I do read the comments first, but sometimes I read the news article before reading comments, and I have found that people twist the article/wording to have something else bad to say about Boris, sometimes the top comments are literally addressed in the news article, and yet sometimes noone combats this (or they do and get downvoted).  
Some concepts I read about, such as UBI, does not make sense to me economically, yet I only ever see comments talking about how we need it, and whenever a UBI system is implemented in another country, the comments would then say ""That's not UBI"". Whyyyyy can't people discuss the pros, cons, logistics of it, or even explain why they think opposing parties disagree with UBI. It's really frustrating to read the sub's comments as I cannot learn about many different viewpoints. What would a conservative think of this news article? Or a lib dem?  
Personally, I'm not sure about Boris or which ""side"" I belong to, but at my workplace with 100+ people in healthcare, practically EVERYONE is conservative, they think Boris can be a plonker, but generally think he's OK. Even with recent covid stuff, or brexit, I asked a few different nurses, admin staff, etc. about their opinions on these topics, and people have answers and views that I never seen in the comments section on Reddit, to me they are very understandable and empathetic reasons too.  
I do understand that subreddits do not speak for ALL members of a group, I.E. Not all Labour voters are angry and twist news articles and stuff, but it does do a disservice to the party when all I can see is an overpowering angry mess that I want to listen to but they won't give the opportunity for others to chime in. I want to hear the quiet voices too to see what they have to say, and then I can decide on an opinion myself knowing I had more information and viewpoints and not feel biased.

107,79jxhl,SharksandPokadots,Lunch with Smother May I aka My JNmom *also a little ranty*,"See bitchbot for earlier posts, if she's working properly. 
I'll give you the basic run down. 
Smother May I is my mom, and a JNMil for my husband.  My parents don't really like my DH. My parents, mostly my mom, are painfully conversative, pacifistic, passive aggressive, manipulative and wishy washy. My DH is the opposite. He's a rough and tumble mans man,  but is extremely loving, physically affectionate and caring once he knows you and trusts you. He's like a big angry looking pit bull that rolls over and whines for a belly rub as soon as I walk over. I didn't thing someone could actually care about me as much as he does. My parents haven't said outright that they dislike him, but the dissapproval is obvious in their actions and words. I think part of it might be that my brothers married into wealthy, academically leaning, upper class society. I did not.  DH and I do really well for people who have recently married, but we're not wealthy.

Smother May I and I went to lunch recently. I was down in town because I work in the area and I figured I'd have to see her eventually so I would rather have it on my terms. Lunch was good. She paid for my sandwhich and I thanked her. We sat in the booth for a while and talked. I tried to act normal, but was on alert for any manipulative bull she might pull. It started off pretty subtle. I will abbreviate Smother May I to SMI for practical purposes.

Me: DH and I want to eventually buy land and have our own place. We want to have land so we can have horses and DH can set up a workshop. He's always wanted to, but never had the chance.

SMI:Oh that would be nice...but land is so expensive. You wouldn't be able to afford it. Maybe If DH worked for another 10 years you could do it but I don't know...I mean it's possible but not likely.
*My mom is not the most encouraging person, if you hadn't noticed. I tell her my dreams and it gets shot down. Thanks mom.*

SMI: You guys wouldn't want to go in on a peice of land together with your dad and I would you?""

Me: No, not really. DH and I really want our own space.

SMI: but if we got 20 acers, you could have ten acers and we could have the other ten. 

Me: Mom, DH and I don't want to share land with people. 

SMI:Too bad we don't have a guest house on our property. You could save so much money staying with us!

Me : DH can't handle living that close to other people. I can't either. We don't want to be able to see other peoples houses. We don't like neighborhoods. it's too close for us. It would be really smothering to live on the same property as you. I would only share property with you if you were no long independent, or something happened to dad.

SMI: I don't think it would be that bad. If we shared a property we could be your live in baby sitters!
*I shut this down real quick. At this point I knew what she was doing. She was pretending to joke about what she really wanted. And I DO NOT want her around my kids like that. Supervised visits only. *

Me: We're not having kids for a while mom....

SMI: Yeah well sharing property and living near my kids is just a dream. It wouldn't ever happen that way I don't think. Out house is only worth X amount anyway...*insert meaningless blather that's trying to cover up her actually really wanting something like that to happen.


To be living with me (or what she would probably view as me living with her because she's a narc that way) and knowing everything I'm doing, when I am coming and going, being around my kids constantly (which I don't have by the way and won't have for a while)...just thinking about it makes me nervous and angry. i don't want her manipulating my kids or thinking they're her do-over babies. Because that's exactly what she would do. 
SMI is partially right about land. It's expensive, in our home state. DH and I are looking outside our state where land is cheaper and there are a few places we are eyeballing as future landplots. I haven't told SMI this because she gets upset when I talk about moving out of state. I have learned not to care when she gets upset, but I like to avoid that if I can because it becomes a big, awkward issue and then the whole day is ruined because of her pouting and pretending not to be upset with me when she actually is upset with me. She even jokingly said she would break DH's arm if he moved me out of state. At the time I took it as a joke, but now I'm a lot more aware of the manipulation my mother has used on me throughout my life. 
When I was 18 and talking about wanting to move out of my home town and be away on my own her constant response was ""Why don't you want to be near us? We want to be near you. You need to be near faaaaaaamily. Why don't you want to be with us? We're your parents and we love you!"" She did this so often that I stopped talking about it, keeping my wants secret. I remember feeling so trapped, my chest tighenting, my stomach feeling sour. You have no idea how freeing it was to marry DH and get out of my parents house.
But I digress. This entire conversation with SMI didn't really surprise me. DH and I are pretty sure she wants us to be dependant, she doesn't want us to have our own place because that means I don't need her. I don't think she thinks about it that way, but she acts that way almost constantly.

SMI is also a terrible driver. My DH won't drive with her, and if we do, he drives. She stops and starts sharply, turning your head into a bouncy ball on the head rest. She doesn't pay attention. She lets the car drift. 
We were leaving the shopping area to go somewhere else to look for a lamp that I wanted for my living room. We were pulling up to a red light and there was already a truck stopped there. SMI gets distracted by something out the window, turns to look and points it out to me, as we're coming up behind someone else. She's not looking where she's going, she's not breaking fast enough. I pressed myself back into the seat and told her to look where she was going.
The light turned green and we went. I sat back my seat, fuming. I was already nervous and uncomfortable around my mom. I had forgotten she drove in a way that made me even more uncomfortable.

Me:Mom can you please look where you're going?

SMI: Oh sorry honey. I forgot that I need to drive different with you in the car because of your accident.

(I was in a severe car accident back in june. Could have died but didn't. Should have been severely injured but wasn't. I die hard, apparently. I'm recovered almost 100% but i still have some nervous tendencies when driving. I prefer to have my husband drive when there are other people in car, but I can drive myself without a problem.) 

I sit there biting my tounge to keep from going off on her. I know how I get when I am angry and I didn't want my reaction to be disproportional to what had happened. She hadn't actually damaged anything, just made me nervous. It was her comment that irked me.
I waited until we got to where we wanted to go to call her on it.I explained why I didn't like what she did. she basically blew me off.

Me: Mom, you need to look where you're going. You weren't paying attention.

SMI: Oh I'm sorry. I forgot you were so senstive about driving.

Me: You weren't looking where you were going. I'm calling you out on bad driving and you're calling my sensitive when I'm not.

SMI*in sweet mommy voice that makes my skin crawl* Oh but you aaaaaare sensitive sweetie. You were in an aaaaaaacident.

I had already started to walk away at this point and just let it go. I found the lamp I wanted. She bought it for me. I thanked her. It is a very nice lamp and I appreciate it, but she still pissed me off. 

She did the same thing again later while driving through a parking lot. She was rolling across the front of the store, looking for an isle to turn into. She drifted in front of another car coming the opposite way and didn't notice until I yelled at her.
SMI :oops! haha!
She turned on her blinker and turned right in front of the car, which had had to stop pretty sharp because we drifted in front of them.

SMI and my dad also dislike the patch I wear on my leather jacket. It says ""do not harm, but take no shit"". I explained what it meant to my mom. When I first got it and put it on, the first time my mom saw it she looked at my DH and said ""You LET her do that?!"" 
Thankfully DH is extremely tactful and avoided the argument. 
This was todays convo about the patch:
Me : I like the patch because of what it means.
SMI:But it's not...nice.
Me: It mean's ""Don't hurt or cause anyone else harm, but don't let anyone hurt you or cause you harm either."" You're just looking at the swear word because it's a bad word. Yes it is a swear word but look at what the phrase means before you say you don't like soemthing.
SMI: ooh...okay...
She pretty much ignored me I think but it seemed like she didn't really care. It was my dad that cared. 
I know this might not belong here but I will be concise.
I recently fround a note that my dad secretly put into my jacket pocket. I don't know when he put it there but it was one of the times I was over at their house. It was about the patch, saying how he didn't like it and sited various scriptures about why the patch was bad and bla bla bla. Now, I am religious, nondenominational and convervative Christian, but I don't want to turn this into a religious deal. It's for context in this conversation. I see why he would disagree with the patch, but I disagree with his conclusion on it being bad just because it had a swear word in it. Basically I can rebuff him with other scripture if it came down to it but he is SOOOOO non confrontational that I would have to put him on a rack to get him to talk about it.
I just feels weird that he went into my pocket to leave it. Like, why couldn't you ask me about it? It strikes me as sneaky and passive aggressive and him trying to parent me or police what I wear\do. It's just creepy. My dad is usually Just Yes, but things like this happen occasionally. I'm not sure what to think about it. Or if I bring it up to my dad at all. I kind of want to tell him to not go into my pockets like that.

Now,all that being said, I don't hate my mom or my dad. I love my parents. But SMI has done a lot of things in the past that have pushed me away. I've tried talking to her about them and it doesn't work. She gaslights me, manipulates me, and acts like everything is fine. 

I just thought of something else she did when I was younger. I came home once (this was before i knew DH existed) in tears, grossly sobbing and throwing myself into her lap while she was watching TV. She was absently patting my back while watching TV. She didn't turn it off. She just kept watching TV while her only and youngest daughter is on her knees with her face buried in her lap, sobbing. I tried to get her attention. She still didn't turn the TV off. I finally stormed into my room and slammed the door. I screamed and cried into my pillow for almost 45 minutes before she opened the door to talk to me. I yelled at her to leave me alone. She convinced me out of my room and made me sit on the couch with her and she hugged me and tried to comfort me...but the TV was still on. 
I called her on it a while later. She did the typical back peddaling, huffing and puffing, getting flustered. I don't remember in detail, but I think I had to drag an apology out of her. I even brought it up to her once recently as an example when we were working a few other things out and her response was a pouting face and ""But wasn't that a long time ago?""

TL:DR I don't want to live on the same property with my parents. Even if the houses were far apart. I would have to be forced into it kicking and screaming. It makes my chest tighten in panic and I almost want to cry just thinking about it. I feel like my parents always want to be as close as possible, always hovering near by, always smothering me. They wanted to move closer to my brother in another state when he had kids, but he shot that down. Now they're doing the same thing to me and I don't have kids! 
I wish I could go VLC or NC altogether without feeling bad. My dad isn't bad at all. 90% of it is my mom. 

Hope you appreciate the llama nibbles. If you want to read my other posts about Smother May I, I reccomend you look up ""you can't have a midwife"" and ""JNMom=JNMIL"" in case bitchbot isn't working.

Thanks for listening.

108,8o3rn8,chevybow,Why does there seem to be such a strong push for Catholics to become as conservative as possible?,"Hello all,   


  
I have not identified as Catholic for at least 8 years now. Back then I simply realized I never really had a belief in any type of God and was only ""Catholic"" because my parents were catholic. In the current age I find myself actively disliking the Catholic Church and am very strongly Atheist\- I used to identify as Agnostic but that seemed to be a weak position because technically\- we should be agnostic about everything since we are not omniscient. I know that god\- at least the way its defined in any major religion today\- does not exist.   


Anywho\- one thing I never really understood is that there seems to be this movement to make the church, and to make Catholics in general\- much more conservative. If you go on /r/Catholicism \(I spend way too much time getting frustrated on there\)\- there are endless posts about people wanting to attend latin mass, women wanting to wear veils, people wanting to dress modestly and reveal no skin \(And absolutely no satanic yoga pants!!\), and tons of posts hating Pope Francis. My question is just... why?   


Its not as if this thing is just centered on that subreddit either. My brother used to be in seminary wanting to be a priest \(thankfully that didn't last long\)\- and people that followed him on instagram would often speak of such traditional things to: There were these women in particular that would criticize other catholic women for not being ""modest"" enough\- or people criticizing others for receiving communion in the hand even though it is deemed okay by the Vatican.   


  
Not sure how it is elsewhere in the world\- but Catholicism seems to be dying. Some people seem to believe that numbers are actually improving because it is near impossible to be considered non\-catholic if you're baptized\- shit I probably still count as a ""Catholic"" as far as the church is concerned. But enter any church in my area and you'll see how once full churches\- where people had to stand because there weren't enough seats\- are now almost completely empty on Sundays, excluding the extremely old people who still stick around. It doesn't make sense to me why so many want to further divide Catholics and criticize others for being ""too progressive""\- including the damn pope!!

Anyone who left have experience with this sort of thing? Did anyone here go with the trend of attending latin masses or similar? After spending tons of time on that sub I just completely don't understand why anyone would want to attend mass in a language they don't understand apart from wanting to fit into a very niche group of catholics to feel accepted and to feel ""cool"" for being different. Although many catholics seem to be full of hate so maybe its just an excuse to further judge others. I mean\- even my brother when he was trying to become a priest didn't understand these people\- he absolutely hated the ultra\-convervatives and found them annoying. Can anyone shine some light on why these people are like this? Catholicism seems to have a rep of being more progressive than other forms of Christianity but these people seem to hate that. I literally just don't understand. ",2018-06-02 16:31:54,42
109,82fjjz,_-shusha-_,CMV: the left has autocratic tendencies,"I am very left when compared to the convervative centre. I believe that everyone should be allowed to live however they like, so long as nobody is being harmed in the process; abortion : yes, police brutality : no, racism and discrimination : no, refugees : yes, etc etc etc. However I am beginning to feel exhausted by the leftist people I am surrounded with (the Berlin leftist scene) and the leftist culture that I find online.

I find that there is an almost authoritarian bent to a lot of the tactics used. You must express yourself in the most roundabout way in order to not offend anyone - and mostly, people aren't even defining what offends *them*, they're being offended for others. This seems over the top. I'm all for someone telling me that they, as a transgender person, find ""transsexual"" offensive because of the word's history. Fine, I didn't know that, I won't use the word then. But, one example that seemed completely over the top : being told that one shouldn't use the word ""blind"" to describe people who can't see, as the word is used to describe *the inability to perceive* colloquially, and blind people *do* perceive, if not visually.....and this attitude, constantly monitoring what you say and how you say it, seems unnecessarily alienating. Also, people refusing to go to social gatherings because there are cis men there - it seems like within the group, due to very relevant experiences had, it has become groupthink to vilify ALL people of that type (in this case cis men). How are you going to incite social change if you're pretending half the population doesn't exist? How are you going to convince them if you refuse to acknowledge their existence and discuss with them how they perceive the world?

I feel like a very strong cohesion is created within this group and ideology, but this closes it off increasingly to the outside and stops people from identifying with the ideals at its heart. I think people like Jordan Petersen have only been so successful and gained so much traction because of this phenomenon, and it's empowering the alt right and other neo right movements. I'm unsure that this group consolidation is the best tactic in fighting racism and sexism and all the other -isms. And since I feel so unsure about this tactic, I feel I may as well not partake in leftist activities, at least not in the ways advocated by these people. It feels as though all these people are shouting in an echo chamber, doing all sorts of activities without even knowing it'll work. All the while, the right is becoming stronger and stronger in my home country and Europe, AND the US as well of course.

I don't mean to discount anyone's actual, socially relevant experiences of discrimination. But I feel that the tolerant ideals espoused by this group aren't always found *within* the group. I can't be bothered going to demonstrations anymore, I find the discussions in my seminars boring and I don't identify any longer with lots of the people in my friend groups.

So, my opinion is that these groups are ineffective and yet constantly self -congratulatory and trying to define reality by their standards without entering into proper dialigue with others - which in my opinion is the only way to convince anyone. If you're unwilling to enter into human communication with people of other convictions, how can you convince anyone, and how can you stay realistic yourself?

So please, change my mind and convince me that these groups are effective. I'm not sure I've expressed all of my thoughts properly, but I'm going to post this anyway. If you need clarification, please ask and I'll clarify in the comments!

Edit: changed autocratic to authoritarian because I was a dumb and used the wrong word.",2018-03-06 08:42:32,7
110,8km46r,sock2014,"See, I can keep secrets!","My girlfriend and I recently had lunch with my parents. She has only been in mom's presence 3 times in the 5 years we've been together.   

Some background: my sister divorced a sadistic narc who has threatened various legal action against family members including me. He has gotten people fired.  For this reason we do not want him to know where my girlfriend lives or works. My mom can't keep her damn mouth shut, and during a convervation with my sister that DAUGHTER WHO IS LIVING WITH EX COULD HEAR from next room, she was talking about where girlfriend worked, and got upset when sister shushed her. Yeh I was livid when I heard that.   

So Girlfriend is now moving to another coast. I finally told my parents. I was going to tell them that the ONLY thing I will reveal is the coast, then promply scewed up and told them the state. Anyway I brought up past incidents where mom could not shut up, and said this was the firm boundry, for safety's sake the only thing I will say is the state.   
She then asked what city. I repeated the boundry.

So.... at the lunch mom is talking about cousin H who is living in state we are moving to.  She talks about things he is doing and says he is able to because he inherited gold bars from his mom. Quote""Gold Bars! You didn't know that, see I can keep a secret!""

Yes, to prove she can keep a secret she reveals a secret to 3 people.

I just did not reply, since pointing out that she proved my point would not have changed anything.",2018-05-19 10:57:01,169

>**History**

&#x200B;

**Tane Mahuta** is the **God of Forest and Trees**. At the beginning of the World, it was he who separated his parents from one another in order for the World to receive light.

Tane takes the aspect of **a giant with a skin as dark as wood**, and a kind demeanor that fits is **role of life giver**. 

Of all the creatures and animals he protects, **he always had a soft spot for birds and killing them unnecessarily can anger the calm giant** who split heaven and earth.

Tane Mahuta (sometimes called Tane) is both wise and witty. 

He acts as the pantheon voice of reason, ready to help his brothers and sisters at all costs. Caring and powerful, he is one of the most active Gods, relentlessly helping his people move forward.

Tane Mahuta has spent a lot of time in the world, **protecting all forms of life** and ensuring prosperity to his people. 

As a tree doctor, a zoologist, an old wise elder teaching the young or a tough colossus building houses for the poor, Tane is **always helping without leading.**

[Source](http://wyrdwalkers.wikidot.com/tane-mahuta)

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

>**Abilities**

&#x200B;

**Passive Ability: ""Growing Refuge"":**

Tane's planted ""World Trees"" grow over time, as long as they are not in the immediate environment of other trees. They will become large ""World Trees"" behind allies can take cover and in which smaller forest animals such as Birds nest. When such a large ""World Tree"" gets destroyed, Tane falls into rage and ""Wrath of the Forest"" recharges faster.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Basic Attacks:  ""Wooden Fists"":**

Tane strikes enemy gods with two wooden fists as hard as metal to cause damage. 

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Ability 1 \[1\]: ""World Trees"":**

Tane plants a tree that grants nearby gods magical protection and life regeneration (Stackable). The tree is considered as an object and can therefore obstruct paths, be destroyed and provide cover.  Tane can maintain up to three such trees at the same time. The life points of the ""World Trees"" scale with Tanes active level. 

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Ability 2 \[2\]: ""Forest Convervation"":**

Tane surrounds himself with a glowing aura that periodically steals life from nearby enemies.  The stolen health points are transmitted in form of healing to nearby allies and his active ""World Trees"".  Tane can instantaneously (by reactivating this ability) create a flash of light at his position, that heals nearby allies and ""World Trees"". Enemies get silenced and damaged. Reactivating this ability ends the aura immediately 

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Ability 3 \[3\]: ""Barkskin"":**

Tane selects himself or a friendly god, who immediately benefits from the magical bark of a nearby ""World Tree"". The god transfers a portion of the suffered damage to it. If the ""World Tree"" gets destroyed by the consequences of this ability, its life force gets transferred to the selected god in form of healing.  This corresponds to the maximum number of health points of the destroyed ""World Tree"". 

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Ultimate Ability \[4\]: ""Wrath of the Forest"":**

Tane stomps enraged into the ground to knock up and damage nearby enemy gods.  Through his stomp, he raises three ""World Trees"" out of the ground, which (after a short delay) immobilize nearby enemy gods with their roots.

113,cz846e,standardtissue,I'm zone 6b and would like a nice yard but I think I may be dumb.,"Hey so my yard pretty much sucks.  The back yard has a good bit of grass but has large patches of violet, and a couple areas where I just can't keep grass growing due to traffic, shade and my own stupidity.  Pretty much the only thing I've ever done correctly with my yard is let a robot take over the mowing.  The rest of the time I've just done completely random things at random times and hoped for the best.  

One section of the front yard is basically a weed convervation area.  There's also plenty of bent grass all over the place.  

Earlier in the year I bought a large bag of high quality seed blend from a local blender and seeded parts of the yard to compensate for where some things were sitting and had completely killed all the grass underneath it.  In the past I've had people tell me I should nuke and replace the yard but with people and pets that never seemed viable. 

So yesterday I broadcast some of the seed blend across the flat portions of the back yard.  Idiot.  No game plan, just random seeding. 

It's already September.  If I spray weed killer now will there be enough time to kill the weeds and seed ?  Alot of the weeds are on a severe slope (45 deg).   What SHOULD I be doing this week if I wanted to pretend I'm a grownup and try to do a proper job ?",2019-09-03 12:39:40,5
114,ctj8bn,TheWinterDeerclops,How Can I Learn to Play Games Like These More Cereberally?,"I'm the kind of guy who always reacts to my opponents in Chest games, and who only realizes what I did after I made my move. I'm the kind of guy who tries to not think too hard about what I'm going to say when it comes to a conservation so I can keep up with it instead of saying something that isn't relevant to the current convervation. I also have ADHD which doesn't help my case.

I mostly play by instincts in general, which is why I want to learn Caustic. I like the idea of playing mindgames with my opponents and out thinking them. I love big brain plays that you see pros doing and I want to do those. I want to learn how to play more defensively and be more patient, but I just don't  have the right mindset. I do stupid stuff all the time and I feel so foolish, never using my traps right and only creating them after I'm being shot at to create cover, which usually kills me due to how slowly they get set up. I never feel like a genius scientist, just some slow shmoe in a hazmat suit.

So, I want to ask this community, how can I play a fast paced game like this more mindfully instead of letting my body do the work? How can I learn to pull off smart plays to win games and not get screwed over by my incompetence? Any help you can give would be greatly appreciated.",2019-08-21 11:30:07,10
115,bqz5w1,tugohunter,Should I Call GF Who Deleted My Number?,"I said she deleted my number because I saw her online on whatsapp but her photo and everything is gone like that she blocked me. I got suspicious for days, because she seemed so much online according to normal days which we start then suddenly she became so much less online in a day on whatsapp. We started to date about one month ago and friday evening we went to my friends house to eat dinner and play games etc. She lives alone (after divorcing her husband) and lives close yo my family home. In the first two weeks I was almost everyday in her home and we slept a lot. I left her home at night and she acted cold and didn't invite me. She told me before that she could go to dinner at her aunt for next day. They don't know about us ( a convervative family ). Nevermind, it was saturday and I wrote her ""good morning, sleep much for me also etc.) at 11 in the morning. She didn't read and answer until and I called her about 20:00 and she didnt respond. That she wrote me ten minutes later ""I'm out with my aunt."" and I said ""ah nice, at least you are alive"". She said ""I told you that I will be with them today"", and I said ""I didn't know you will be with them ALL DAY"".

&amp;#x200B;

Next day is Sunday and we can see each other and I can go to her home without worries (her security guard of their complex knows her aunt and she suspect that he gives info their aunt and he doesn't work on sunday's).  She usually wakes up early in the week, last week I went her and we fucked all day. So we didn't plan earlier but I called her about 10:30 and she didn't response. About 12 she wrote me ""

\-good morning, you called me early. did you see me in your dream?

\-no, I started day early, what are you doin?

\-I woke up now. If you will ask that ""will we meet?"" No, I will study. (she has university entry exam on next weekend)

\-I thought we could go to place which we talked about before.

\-another day. this is my last week.

\-ok.

&amp;#x200B;

and that day I went to picnic with my friends and I put on my IG story photo of grill. I didn't write her anything, she didn't write me also and she didn't be online on whatsapp until next day. I got suspicious but didn't write her good morning etc. this day and she wrote me in the morning about 8:30

\-what's wrong with you?, do you have a problem?

\-what the fuck are you talking about?

\-mind your business

\-you mind your business.

&amp;#x200B;

then she blocked me. At least I thought this but later I cached her online, so she just deleted my number. Also she is still on my IG and follows me. I didn't write anything, didn't call her. She put a story and I saw it about 3 hours later. She didn't see mine etc. Some people said, ""she is angry to you because you didn't wrote her yesterday, you went out and didn't talk her and didn't write her good morning etc.""  I didn't think like this but they made me confused.

We have a few very prominent convervative voices, but words like ""titan"" should be reserved for the likes of Plato, John Locke, etc.

Seems to me that the Daily Wire is basically becoming the Milennial National Review, which is fine, and Shapiro is the prominent figurehead of DW. His influence, credentials, and willingness to debate and/or converse with most anyone across the aisle gives him a top spot among intellectuals, whether you agree with him or not.

Throw Dennis Prager in the mix, too. Prager U is probably the most influential conservative channel on youtube. Also, the guy writes a column for both NR and DW; he's on AM radio and on Youtube. He's doing a lot of leg work with bridging the generational gap between conservatives.

Thomas Sowell is probably the only living individual I'm willing to call an intellectual titan. But even then I hesitate.

122,ahfi1f,tmaffin,Whose Logo is Smallest?,"Hello fellow data nerds! There's been some discussion about the size of party logos on some by-election candidate signs (notably, the BC Liberal candidate).

But whose party logo actually is smallest? Let's see what the data tells us!

‚Äî NEY (Greens): 1.13% of sign  
‚Äî HARRIS (BC Liberals): 1.3% of sign  
‚Äî MALCOLMSON (NDP): 3.04% of sign  
‚Äî GREENWOOD (Convervatives): 8.01% of sign

METHODOLOGY: I took photos of four candidate signs I could find, then multiplied the width and height units to come up with an overall sign size. Then I did the same with their logos (taglines or logos were not included, unless they were part of the actual party name) and divided the logo dimensions by the overall sign dimensions. Yellow boxes indicate measured region.

I'm happy to add the other two candidates if someone can send me photos of their signs.

I've added this data to the master by-election spreadsheet at [http://bit.ly/nanaimobyelection](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Fnanaimobyelection%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0Is8-FdRrgWSANVwluR5WNQapgT8KXpmS6sxwpL_BXi65anGyoY6UdG-A&h=AT1mIUHM8LFiP5_REKnHmKe0MMKXl6RT2BmTaqaagHRAdR_t0M3lkOaqNeclhu4Jqw8N92w7RT3BEm4YvUbTDjb7l3WHfkVP-VkJwyv3cUbICe2eUKkCkkVy0lzrDRsa4gsUP3cdjEPhgo5VVWxUzZCcF5wfimtjqSojuQ_mXK8jBo1JVQ)

Convervative billionaires (Koch, Adelson, Marriott, Scaife) all seem more concerned with influencing policy, specifically policies that allow them to preserve more of their wealth (lower taxes, no estate tax).

I started meditating 9 months ago and have been slowly learning more about the practice and the philosophy. I remember hearing a thing about a teacher saying that even the most promising student would take 9 years to enlightenment. I'm def not the best student, so realize I have a long way to go.

I've done a little bit of work to find a tradition. Did a Japanese zen daylong + a bit of study, went to a pureland church for a bit, stayed at a theravadist monastery for 10 days, went to a few nyingma talks. And that's not even the half of all the traditions to check out. Issa lot. 

They are all so different.  So still figuring that out. I feel the most connected to the Theravadist tradition so far. The Pali canon is beautiful and I think told simply.  But for me monastery was kinda ehh. It was hard work and grew alot in my practice but for me parts felt too dry and I felt they had very convervative stances regarding periodic psychedelic or cannabis use for lay practicioners. 5 precepts, I get it.

125,99psdt,scnoob100,[Discussion] New Canadian Conservative Party,"Maxime Bernier, who just barely placed second in the PC leadership race last summer against Scheer has decided to start a new Convervative Party: [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-maxime-bernier-to-make-announcement-ahead-of-conservative-convention/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-maxime-bernier-to-make-announcement-ahead-of-conservative-convention/)

&#x200B;

In the election race I was rooting for Bernier as I supported his libertarian views. However, in the time since Scheer has impressed me with his support for free speech, denouncing of identity politics, and ceding some territory on LGBT issues. Meanwhile, Bernier has sort of tilted a bit towards identity politics, in my opinion (others may know better than I on any of this, I am not in any way an expert). In fact, if the identity politics right follow Bernier to his new party, that might be the best thing to happen to the current conservative party, and would likely cause me to vote for the current Conservative party for the first time in my life. With that said, I would REALLY love to hear from conservatives who likely have been following this more closely than I have.

126,45yjji,mhocmorningstar,Recap of the MBBC-Endeavour Economic Debate,"##**Recap of the MBBC-Endeavour Economic Debate by /u/valttuuuuuuuuuu**
 
 

The first debate which was hosted by /u/Jas1066 began late, but fortunately the Chancellor finally showed up. It was a fierce debate, with each side holding up strongly. Rather unfortunate to see the smaller parties couldn't take part, would've been interesting to hear the Economic plans of for example the UKIP and the Greens, but I guess we'll have to take a look at their manifestos when they get published.

##Question 1: What is the most radical plan for the economy in your manifesto?

/u/colossalteuthid began the night by saying the RSP's radical economic plans included the democratisation of workplaces, which would be achieved by slowly transferring the ownership of businesses first by forcing parts of business profits to go to buyout schemes, in which shares would be given to the employees. He said co-operation was key in achieving this, and said the RSP would work with Labour and possibly the Liberal Democrats during the next term to achieve this. He ended his statement by saying the RSP's budget would improve living conditions through fiscal policy. 

 

The Lib Dem /u/Ajubbajub said his party's most radical plan is to keep on doing what they're doing, which is maintaining a high rate of income and a high rate of basic income, which would continue to be given to 16 year olds. He said the Liberal Democrats were committed to ensuring low income families get the support they need. The Conservative party representative however wondered if the Liberal Democrats really wanted to keep running a budget with a huge black hole. He however quickly dismissed the idea of this black hole, saying it was only created ""because of some idiotic Tories not being able to read the spreadsheet"".

 

The Tories' /u/Mepzie said introducing a negative income tax is the most radical part of The Conservative Party's manifesto, which he said would help incentivise people to work, which a policy of basic income doesn't accomplish according to him. He also said they would reduce bureaucracy surrounding benefits. /u/colossalteuthid however criticised the negative income tax as ""disincentive to work"" and said it would do damage to the working poor, since it would be withdrawn so quickly if you were employed. He also said the RSP's guaranteed minimum income was fairer. He also said The RSP supported the working poor, while the Tories ""want to keep them unemployed"".

##Question 2: Should all qualifications and training be free to the recipient?

The Lib Dem's /u/ajubbajub responded shortly, saying under a LD lead government there would be a strong economy. He continued his statement, by saying most training should be free, including university tuition. He however said, that if a person wanted further degrees, they would have to pay for them. The Lib Dem representative ended his statement by saying basic income helped people who hadn't been able to before to take the time out to get a degree. /u/ajubbajub also said the Lib Dems would always oppose graduate tax, as it disincentivises people to go into high earning jobs. 

 

/u/colossalteuthid said education should be free the same way healthcare is, and that it should be funded through progressive taxation. He justified this by saying society benefits from an educated workforce. He continued his statement by saying the abolishing of tuition fees was the big achievement of the last parliament, and that education should be well funded.

 

While the Lib Dem and RSP policies were rather similar, the Tory policy was from a completely other side. /u/Mepzie said the Government shouldn't spend it's money paying for the qualifications of those who could afford it, and that he supported tuition fees. 
/u/colossalteuthid of course immediately opposed this, pointing to the US as an example of a country where ""Debts burdens become clearer"", and said the Conservative party wanted everybody to have to take massive loans to get degrees. The Conservative representative followed up by saying because of the lack of tuition fees, many institutions were underfunded, but /u/colossalteuthid reminded this meant that the government was under funding institutions.

##Question 3: How do you propose to combat those who take benefits, but have no intention of work?

The Liberal Democrat provided what was in my opinion his best statement of the debate. He said this was a problem ""blown out of proportion"" by the tabloids, and that there are in fact very few who choose not to work. He also said most people prefer working to doing nothing, and that the current schemes were plenty. The Tory Representative later said he agreed with the statement regarding the tabloids..

 

The RSP rep said he believes people should have the right not to work, and that if they were worker controlled they would be overall better. He also said, that while all policies tried to incentivise people to work, the RSP policies were the only ones that made work better. /u/colossalteuthid continued to rant about the democratising of workplaces, but was largely ignored.

 

The Conservative unsurprisingly went back to his talk of the Negative Income Tax that they want to implement, and that it made working better than not working. He said this might not get everybody to work, but would be a step in the right direction, presumably both in a political and a moral way.

##My personal summary:

The RSP and Lib Dem strategies seemed rather similar, while the Tory strategy was completely different. The clear winners of the debate were the Conservative and RSP representatives, who fought their own positions well. The Lib Dem representative was often left in the background with rather dull and sparse comments, while the RSP and Convervative reps continued fighting over issues, and pointing out faults in each others' ideas.

127,5jbuo7,pcDemolitionist,Boycott SKYPE!,"I've been keeping up with the the social media lately, and it's quite refreshing to see convervatives coming to together in an effort to end PC bullshit once and for all. But we still have a lot of ground to cover if we'd like to see our efforts have a lasting effect. Which is why I propose we boycott skype, atleast for the time being. The reason for this, is that skype is sneakily trying to make us forget the reason for season. If you've been an active user of skype (newish feature?) ""Moji's"", you'll have noticed they've added a few Christmas themed Moji's, one of them depicting Santa Claus. My nephew sent me the Santa Claus one this morning in fact. If you press the play button on said Santa Moji, he give's a jolly ""Ho ho ho"", and then a forced ""HAPPY HOLIDAY!"". I could not help but let out a sigh after hearing that. I am so sick of this shit, he's wearing a Santa Hat for pete sake! Why not just go the full mile and finally let Santa say ""Merry Christmas""? It's so ridiculous. What we need more than anything right now in this PC climate, is to to come together, and say, enough IS enough. You don't have to boycott Microsoft altogether, but atleast try to abstaine from skype, atleast until the Christmas season has passed. Share this with anyone else who cares about Christmas, and try discourage other's from buying skype credit. Do NOT support blatent liberal bias. ",2016-12-20 00:46:41,3

131,3mnst6,Mastajdog,Pepper's Planned Party - an Annorax control build with bonus ground melee tank,"---				
				
**Build Description**				
				
---				
				
The space build is setup to be a fairly standard controll/debuff build. Phased Tetryon is fairly nasty - it'd be Phased Polaron if there was an omni-polaron that wasn't crafted, but tetryon isn't too bad either. It's job is to spike during the GW (which should have quite the pull), and hopefully reciprocity can get the FAW/KLW/TS back up faster. Since I have my TT doffed, and it's not meant to be a pure dps build, I'm okay with having to wait a bit longer than GCD for those - so long as they're up for the GW, everything's cool.

The ground build is a melee tank build. Crammed with self-buffs, it should be hitting very close to the resist cap, and also be at an absurdly high hitpoint level. Medical Vanguard should also take care of my shields as well as they'll need, and the immunity to root/stun/knockback below 50% hp, should I ever get there, will be handy.

It has a space trait setup and a ground trait setup because I'd swap between queues, and for story missions who cares.

This is a WIP build, so any advice/suggestions/questions are welcome.

133,6px4h9,Just_Lynn,What should I do?,"All right, Hello there. I'm Lynn, short for Madilyn. MtF transgender, late teens.
So, I will try to make myself more clear and present myself a bit before, so you will know with who you are talking.

Okay, It took me a lot of time to finally  be able to post anything. I have hard times when it comes to express myself, especially to speak about personal problems.
Well, I was bullyed a lot in my life, isolation and such are still a problem for me as now, but I guess I'm working them out slowly.

As now, I found I'm a transgender a while ago. First, I wanted to accept it, I was struggeling to do everything as girlish as I could, maybe it was to prove something to myself. Even thought I had no reason. I came out to my internet friends, that didn't go well as the majority of them instantly-rejected me. I can't blame them for that because I'm not able to. I live in a religious-convervative country where literally, if you are trans/gay/different, there's a chance that you may end hospitalized if you show it outside. Well, then I tried to come out to my family, mom and dad. They kept screaming and me, I broke down crying while coming out to them though, and asking questions such as: "" You like to be fucked? You are gay? You like to kiss boys? So you want to be a girl but you still love girls? How the fuck do you image vagina + vagina sex? "" I HATED them ever since. Even thought they started to behave better with me, they still consider me as their 'boy' and such. Honestly, as now I'm into girls, but if I'd have the right body, I'm sure I'd be into both. I just don't feel attracted atm, with the actual body, to men.  Then, after a while, I was trying to deny everything. I was pretty much in a period of 'living like nothing wrong happened'.  Trying to be as man as I could, I even attempted hunting. Guess what? I woke up to reality, that NO. That doesn't apply to me. I'm not a man, I'm just a girl searching for the truth, trying to prove myself something. I finally found myself at that time. And trust me, it hurts me to grow in this body. It drives me insane.

As now, I did NOT attend any therapist or such, because I was not able to. In my country, there are no good therapists to speak to about my actual problems, as I could see. Well, atleast not in my life-radius, plus I'm a known person in my country, so everyone in north-western area of my country would know that I'm a trans if I'd attend a therapist and such.. And, I couldn't speak face-to-face with then in anyway, because I just couldn't. And I knew they wouldn't pass me as a transgender because I'm actually very tomboyish. Right now, I hate skirts/dresses. Maybe I would give them a try if I had the right body thought. But I do have a tomboyish behaviour and clothing, sometimes (not everytime, but in the large ammount of my time) . Even though I'm a girl, I identify as one and I am one, literally. 

About online therapists, I was thinking about going to one, althought I'm not confortable at all with webcam because I just hate my face in general, and I'm not confortable enough with my voice-chat because I hate how my voice sounds. And just in general, while coming to typing, I can express my emotions, my feelings much easier while typing in a chat, without being face-to-face for some reasons. ( I tried to do voice training regiment, thought that doesn't work well for me as because my dad was ready to break my neck when he saw what voice I got, being able to sing almost like a female thought, I lost it because I didn't keep practising it and .. yeah..:( Not able to redo some soon.)

Coming to that, I actually hate looking in the mirror, since  1 year or so. I just find the person in the mirror different. No, He's not me. And trust me, I'd smash that mirror in a heartbeat. And honestly, I'm hardly confortable with going outside with this body as well. Just with EVERYTHING. I am pretty much a reflection what the society around me want to see, now what I am. Everytime I would hear my birth name, I'd get nervous, everytime someone would speak to me in real life I'd get nervous, or anything. I cry a lot yeah, I do. 
I feel like I'm not growning in the right body. I wasn't suicidal thought.

I was thinking of DIY this year, thought it's a hard choice for me as I'd have to hide the changes for about 2-4 years, untill I'd be able to get a stable financial stage and get out of this messy country, probably move to US.
And, I don't know if I'd have enough money to actually do it, thought I'm while to work online in any possible way.

So, just so everyone will know. I'm not new into this whole thing. I over-researched a lot and even spoke with people about this, about DIY, SRS since first attempts, adventuring up to NSFW pics and such. I did it on my own,  because in my country everything about LGBT and Transgender in general, are hated. It is considered an Mental Illness, so I guess you get the point.

Sorry for poor expressing skills, It's really hard for me to actually do that. It took a lot for me to encourage myself and post this.
I know it may sound to be be a desperate post, well maybe because I trully am.

* I'd wish to get some suggestions on what to actually do, and how to do it. Some past experiences that may help me, any advices that may find their spot here are welcome.
Actually, anything that you think may help me thought my journey.
From anyway of earning money to tips about transitioning, tips on how I may do to get better, links to usefull communities for DIY, anything. *

Tl;dr ; I just can't do one. It was hard enough for me to write this, thanks if you are going to read it thought. Just looking for different * advices and such. *",2017-07-27 11:34:12,5

136,17i8xo,PenguinOnTheTele,"Non-socially-conservative redditors, what are the best strategies / ways to talk about social issues in a constructive way to extremely socially-conversative close friends?","Please provide positive, constructive answers (not ""don't do it"" or ""impossible""). It is a difficult question since many social-convervatives hold such strong, deeply-rooted beliefs. ",2013-01-29 11:56:24,3
137,2ufyps,MultiBugOrganism,What's the line between acceptable satire and oppressive speech? (related to Charlie Hebdo incident),"Let me begin by saying that I'm uncompromisingly for the protection of speech in society (though not in the ""Freeze Peach"" sense of being able to babble shit on internet forums, of course).

Something that's been bothering me lately is the #JeSuisCharlie ""meme"" and subsequent reactions, including those by people of the Muslim faith. There's been some debate over whether the solidarity with Charlie Hebdo is Islamophobic, and personally I'm pretty firmly on the side of ""no"".

Hebdo posted cartoons, often with somewhat shocking and offensive content, but it seems like they were rooted in distaste for religious conservatives in general. While there's certainly something to be said for rising above the juvenile ""/r/atheism approach"", conservative Muslims are generally no better in their treatment of gender, sexual, and social progressivism than their Christian counterparts. Hebdo never seemed to advocate violence or oppression of the Muslim populace aside from mocking their conservative beliefs and values, and that seems fair to do in a secular society.

Although Muslims are certainly an oppressed group in French (and indeed, much of Western) society, there has to be some acceptable room for criticism of convervative Muslim attitudes. While the rights of Muslims to be Muslim should be respected, the right of Muslims to perpetuate reactionary attitudes unexamined   just isn't there.

I have sympathy for Muslims, especially in Europe -- I see many parallels between their treatment and the treatment of African-Americans in the US. But the same way I reject problematic but legitimate groups like Black Evangelicals or the Nation of Islam in the US, I feel as though conservative Muslims deserve a critical eye on the left. 

Can anyone kinda help me work through this? Point out any factors I'm missing?",2015-02-01 14:57:54,6
138,2j2t2q,confusedthrowawayonc,"Am I (42f) just an old fuddy duddy that needs to ""get with the times"" with my SO (35m)?","My SO and I have been together for a year and a half (a little bit more).    It has been a strained relationship for the most part, but I have never felt he cheated on me.    I have 3 kids.   He has 2.

This summer, after a big fiasco, we ended the relationship.    During the time that we were apart for a week, he did get on Craigslist (platonic) to find friends.   He doesn't really have any friends, so he thought he could find some on Craigslist.     The thing is, he gets along better with females than with males because they're more understanding.   He also got on Tinder with the idea of making friends.

A week later, I came back and wanted to work things out.    He told me about this and I was very upset.    It bothered me that he would do this so soon after we broke up and it bothered me that he used these methods instead of the good old fashioned methods of going out to meet people.

I was raised Catholic, but right now, I am on the fence between convervative vs. liberal.    I'm not uptight conservative, but I'm not way left either.    But I was taught that a relationship is between two people and no one else.    I don't really believe in threesomes or online dating or even finding people online.   What's wrong with the good old fashioned way of just meeting people as they come along?

I do not like that he goes out to meet these people and won't even share them with me.   He says that he wants to get to know them and make sure they are ""good friends"" before he introduces them to me.    He also says that he is afraid that I might steal his friends away from him.    I have a very charming personality while he is more of an introvert and I can understand this, but it is not my intention to steal anyone from him.

This past week, he showed me SnapChat and how he has like two or three women sending him nude videos and pictures.    I am like....sigh.    These aren't women he knows or has ever met, but they are women from like /r/dirtysnapchat or something like that.    It just bothers me.

I don't know if he is, but I feel like he is sending them videos of himself as well.   This, to me, feels like cheating.    Even though there is no physical contact.

I have asked him to show me his phone so that I can see that there is nothing going on.    But he won't let me read it.   He says it is ""his"" phone and his personal property, which I understand.   But I let him use my phone all the time.   I have nothing to hide on my phone.   But him.   He takes his phone with him everywhere.   To the bathroom.   He puts it under the bed or between the mattress or under his pillow while he's sleeping.    I feel like he is hiding something.    I did ask him, but he says that he is just afraid that I won't like how he has conversations with his ex wife.   I am like??     Is it right of me to ask?    I mean, I just want to reassure myself that there is nothing going on.     He says that I am bothered by him making friends.    I am NOT AT ALL.   I just don't like that he makes friends on Craigslists, KIK, Snapchat, whatever.    I just wish he would make friends the old fashioned way and let me meet them as well.    He knows all my friends.

Now I'm fully aware that this is a technical world we live in, but I'm struggling to see where my morals lie today anymore.    I've only been with 4 men in my life, and was married for 15 years.   Been divorced 2 years now and I have only been with him since.    I do believe a relationship is between two people.

Am I wrong?   Or do I need to suck it up and ""get with the times""?    I have signed up for a Tinder account as of yesterday, but the whole thing scares me.    I don't see how I can just meet a whole bunch of men and try to be friends with them.    How do I handle this?    Thanks in advance.",2014-10-12 20:47:49,1
139,xldcg,Ganrao,The Most (only?) Redeeming and Defensable Conservative Talking Point - Defending The 2nd Amendment,"I feel like this really needs acknowledged by progressives. 

The first and most important thing to keep in mind when discussing gun control is that the bad guys (criminals, people with mental issues) already have guns, and getting law abiding citizens to turn in their guns leaves them defenseless. Like the myth of Eve and the apple or Pandora's box, now that humanity has created gunpowder *we cannot un-discover it*. **We can only ensure those who are just have access to the means of defending themselves.**

I agree some form screening or a wait period should be required to buy a gun, but also consider that whatever laws are enacted, *someone who wants a gun will get a gun*. It is like prohibition, the harder you make something to get, the more money criminals will make helping people circumvent the law. Again, this is only helping people who already don't follow the law, and hurting responsible members of society if the restrictions are made too severe.

Finally, criminals and home protection aside, the real reason we're all supposed to be allowed to own weapons is to prevent the government from becoming tyrannical and opressive. *We are guaranteed the right to replace our government by force if necessary*, and of course this right is very inconvenient for those who enjoy the benefits of the status quo (namely, every huge company that has made record profits in the years following the start of this depression).

When someone says ""the authors never imagined automatic weapons when they wrote that"" it is a fallacy. *It doesn't matter*, because at the time of the writing **the intent was for the public to have access to the same type of armamant that the military had.** How can you fight an opressive government when they have automatics and you don't? When this was written our country had just recently been founded via armed and violent revolution. This amendment was basically making what they did retro-actively legal.

Finally, *a high rate of gun ownership in no way predisposes a society towards increased gun related violence.* For proof of this all you have to do is look up the gun related crime rates in Canada and Switzerland. They both have high gun ownership per capita, but far, far lower reported gun related crimes. If you or someone you love has been hurt by a gun, I'm sorry, I firmly believe the real root of gun violence in the USA is our decaying democracy. If we put more effort into combating poverty and bigotry, improved our public schools, and ended the war on drugs, we would see a *far greater reduction* in gun related violence than any number of gun control laws would ever produce.

I don't want to sound like a conspiratard, but think about what happens when the ~~convervatives~~ government funnels the majority of society's money into the hands of a few (already done), and then those liberals we elect to fight that attempt to restrict our gun ownership. Without any economic power we are left disenfranchised, as (I'm sure many of you wil agree) our politicians only serve the wealthy. Without weapons, we are left defenseless as they take our homes through illegal foreclosures (I am not suggesting you shoot bankers, only that you consider the difficulty in supressing an unarmed population vs. an armed one).

Now add in the quiet militarization of our police forces across the country. They have [tanks](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=police+tanks&um=1&hl=en&sa=N&biw=1011&bih=596&tbm=isch&tbnid=HhVcZEJ1BggHDM:&imgrefurl=http://need4trth.blogspot.com/2011/11/occupy-evictions-philly-and-los.html&docid=qCufm9sW3UUw4M&imgurl=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ij8IQnts1B8/TtaHcbC90_I/AAAAAAAAA44/IcHHdDkeESc/s1600/DA_arpaio_tank.jpg&w=400&h=300&ei=zhEbUK6DCqOV0QGynICQCQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=388&vpy=286&dur=8722&hovh=194&hovw=259&tx=132&ty=218&sig=117514701466564064888&page=2&tbnh=131&tbnw=173&start=15&ndsp=20&ved=1t:429,r:7,s:15,i:147). When was the last time a supervillain or a communist cell attempted to take over YOUR city? As well, **it is now illegal (with a 10 year jail sentence) to protest anywhere that Secret Service agents are babysitting someone, which can mean basically anywhere you would find someone you want to protest against**.

Concerned yet? I am.

140,2h7jzu,ptupper,Quick & Dirty supply system for post-apocalypse/survival games,"FATE generally says that you should not sweat the small stuff, e.g. instead of counting the rounds in your weapon, just have the GM slap you with an ""Out of Ammo"" Aspect. 

So, how can we apply this to a genre in which limited equipment is an ongoing problem for the characters? It goes against the thesis of FATE to keep track of food, water, ammunition and so on. 

This rules variant assumes that characters will be scavenging for supplies and converving them as they go, and that can be kept in the background. However, there are moments when the characters' supplies run low. 

Each character has a Supply track, along with three Consequences. On any Skill/Approach use, in addition to invoking FATE points, the character can also use up some of their supplies. This effectively creates an extra FATE point which can be spent on the current role as either a +2 or a re-roll. It cannot be held for later, nor does it count towards a character's Refresh. 

A character may have some (usually a very small number, one or two) Supply boxes. Unlike regular Stress tracks, each Supply box has only one use. Depending on how lenient the GM is, the characters may have no Supply boxes, and any uses of Supply goes directly into Consequences. 

Supply Consequences function much like other Consequences. They act like Aspects that can be Compelled. 

* Out of Ammo
* Out of Water
* Out of Gas
* Used up all the antibiotics
* Water pump is jury-rigged & unreliable

Unlike regular Consequences, they can be ""fixed"" through gameplay or by the passage of time. 

This can apply at the larger scales of the adventuring group or the larger community.

142,3destp,canadian_tire,"Potentially screwed up saving with mutual funds, need advice.","So I made a dumb decision (in my opinion). I have about $33k saved up in the 4 funds (following the CCP Convervative TD e-Series portfolio).

* 70% in the Canadian Bond Index

* 30% in Canadian, US, and International Indexes

I'm continuously adding money to these mutual funds, but I want to know if it is wise to stop and leave it as is with how the market might be headed. 

My plan was to buy a house in 2-3 years with however much money I saved up by then. I had some pretty bad luck, because I transferred the funds from another mutual fund to the CCP Conservative Portfolio at the highest point it had gone this year, so I'm down about $400 in total; not too bad.

Should I stop contributing to the mutual fund, and instead put the money into a regular savings account or even a Money Market fund? If the news about a recession is true, I'm not sure if it's wise to keep purchasing units and rather just keep the money aside in a high-interest savings account.

Hoping to get some advice from you wise people! 

Thanks in advance.

**TL;DR**: I have $33k saved in a CCP Conservative TD e-Series fund. I mass bought in January at the highest price the funds had been when I transferred from another mutual fund; down $400 in total, but the Canadian Bond Index specifically I'm down $700.

144,r3fqxq,wonderingpitmaster,I finally understand freedom. My escape from conservatism/qanon,"I will start out saying that I am 24 years old.

I got caught up in the conservative movement in 2016. I was brainwashed into supporting trump and just being a staunch maga supporter. I became semi famous on youtube and facebook for my extremist views of being a black conservative. I wanted a place to feel like i belong. I wanted to be part of something special. 

Over the time I had this feeling of something being wrong. It was a nagging gut feeling that, I was caught in a cult. It was like being in a hivemind. In 2017 I began to hear about this Q anon thing. I paid no attention to it and i thought it was weird. Suddenly I began to listen to it. At first it seemed as if it made sense. I felt like i finally cracked the code(so i thought) to why things were the way they were.

I felt like i had some secret knowledge. In truth i was stupid. For 2 years 2018-2020. I was somewhat heavy into Q anon. Then something broke in me. That same feeling came back. 

The feeling of being in a deadly cult. I felt like i was part of the modern day branch davidians. If i thought differently, i was insulted and berated. I got called liberal, fake, idiot, and other things that i wish to no repeat on here. I felt alone. 

I began to ""deprogramme"" around late 2020 to early this year. I started to talk to and ask doctors about the vaccine and the science behind it. I asked politicians and business owners about the political aspects of america. I asked my friends, family, and coworkers the same questions. As i asked around, i slowly began to come to my senses. 

I began to realize how, extreme and radical i became. I lost friends, family members, good romantic relationships all because of my actions and viewpoints. The world wasnt against me. I was against the world. I was at war with myself. 

I realized how brainwashed these q anon people were. How flawed their world view was. I feel like i wasted my youth. I wish i never even met these people. I regret my decisions and i miss my old self. 

I used to be such a nice person. I loved anime(and I still do), i treated everyone equally. I wasnt always angry or depressed. I wasnt a flaming racist(even though im black), nor was I a ""redpilled"" person.

2021 has been a year of deprogramming myself. I spat that redpill up and became somewhat normal.
I dont see myself being radical anymore. That mindset changed and as a result my life changed for the better. I met new friends, and reunited with old ones. I found myself being less angry, and less depressed. 

I see the world in a completely different light. 

Thank God i am able to atleast spend the rest of my youth at peace with myself, and with others.

Sorry for the long explanation. I just had to vent out my journey and my walk away from conservatism/qanon.",2021-11-27 09:25:42,2867

*What I saw at the National Conservatism Conference.*

[**David Brooks**](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/david-brooks/) | November 18, 2021

Rachel Bovard is one of the thousands of smart young Americans who flock to Washington each year to make a difference. She‚Äôs worked in the House and Senate for Republicans Rand Paul, Pat Toomey, and Mike Lee, was listed among the ‚ÄúMost Influential Women in Washington Under 35‚Äù by *National Journal*, did a stint at the Heritage Foundation, and is now policy director of the Conservative Partnership Institute, whose mission is to train, equip, and unify the conservative movement. She‚Äôs bright, cheerful, and funny, and has a side hustle as a sommelier. And, like most young people, she has absorbed the dominant ideas of her peer group.

One of the ideas she‚Äôs absorbed is that the conservatives who came before her were insufferably naive. They thought liberals and conservatives both want what‚Äôs best for America, disagreeing only on how to get there. But that‚Äôs not true, she believes. ‚ÄúWoke elites ‚Äî increasingly the mainstream left of this country ‚Äî do not want what we want,‚Äù she told the National Conservatism Conference, which was held earlier this month in a bland hotel alongside theme parks in Orlando. ‚ÄúWhat they want is to destroy us,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNot only will they use every power at their disposal to achieve their goal,‚Äù but they‚Äôve already been doing it for years ‚Äúby dominating every cultural, intellectual, and political institution.‚Äù

As she says this, the dozens of young people in her breakout session begin to vibrate in their seats. Ripples of head nodding are visible from where I sit in the back. These are the rising talents of the right ‚Äî the Heritage Foundation junior staff, the Ivy League grads, the intellectual Catholics and the Orthodox Jews who have been studying Hobbes and de Tocqueville at the various young conservative fellowship programs that stretch along Acela-land. In the hallway before watching Bovard‚Äôs speech, I bumped into one of my former Yale students, who is now at McKinsey.

Bovard has the place rocking, training her sights on the true enemies, the left-wing elite: a ‚Äútotalitarian cult of billionaires and bureaucrats, of privilege perpetuated by bullying, empowered by the most sophisticated surveillance and communications technologies in history, and limited only by the scruples of people who arrest rape victims‚Äô fathers, declare math to be white supremacist, finance ethnic cleansing in western China, and who partied, a mile high, on Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs Lolita Express.‚Äù

The atmosphere is electric. She‚Äôs giving the best synopsis of national conservatism I‚Äôve heard at the conference we‚Äôre attending ‚Äî and with flair! Progressives pretend to be the oppressed ones, she tells the crowd, ‚Äúbut in reality, it‚Äôs just an old boys‚Äô club, another frat house for entitled rich kids contrived to perpetuate their unearned privilege. It‚Äôs Skull and Bones for gender-studies majors!‚Äù She finishes to a rousing ovation. People leap to their feet.

I have the sinking sensation that the thunderous sound I‚Äôm hearing is the future of the Republican Party.

When I came down to Florida for the National Conservatism Conference, I was a little concerned I‚Äôd get heckled in the hallways, or be subjected to the verbal abuse I occasionally get from Trump supporters. Judging by their rhetoric, after all, these are the fire-breathers, the hard-liners, the intellectual sharp edge of the American right.

But everyone was charming! I hung around the bar watching football each night, saw old conservative friends, and met lots of new ones, and I enjoyed them all. This is the intellectual wing of the emerging right. Many of them have spent their lives at progressive places like Princeton, New York, Hollywood, and D.C. Their bodies and careers are in the Republican coastal megalopolis ‚Äî but their minds and mouths are in Trumpland. As one young man told me late one night, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd like to dislike Bill Kristol, but he got us all jobs.‚Äù

The movement has three distinctive strains. First, the people over 50 who have been hanging around conservative circles for decades but who have recently been radicalized by the current left. Chris Demuth, 75, was for many years president of the American Enterprise Institute, which used to be the Church of England of American conservatism, but now he‚Äôs gone populist. ‚ÄúNatCons are conservatives who have been mugged by reality,‚Äù he told the conference. Seventy-three-year-old Glenn Loury, a Brown University economist, was a conservative, then a progressive, and now he‚Äôs back on the right: ‚ÄúWhat has happened to public discourse about race has radicalized me.‚Äù

The second strain is made up of mid-career politicians and operatives who are learning to adapt to the age of populist rage: people like Ted Cruz (Princeton, Harvard), J. D. Vance (Yale Law), and Josh Hawley (Stanford and Yale).

The third and largest strain is [the young](https://archive.md/o/vtL4y/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/princeton-young-conservatives-trump/604192/). They grew up in the era of Facebook and MSNBC and identity politics. They went to colleges smothered by progressive sermonizing. And they reacted by running in the other direction. I disagreed with two-thirds of what I heard at this conference, but I couldn‚Äôt quite suppress the disturbing voice in my head saying, ‚ÄúIf you were 22, maybe you‚Äôd be here too.‚Äù

The Information Age is transforming the American right. Conservatives have always inveighed against the cultural elite ‚Äî the media, the universities, Hollywood. But in the Information Age, the purveyors of culture are now corporate titans. In this economy, the dominant means of economic production are cultural production. Corporate behemoths are cultural behemoths. The national conservatives thus describe a world in which the corporate elite, the media elite, the political elite, and the academic elite have all coagulated into one axis of evil, dominating every institution and controlling the channels of thought.

At the heart of this blue oligarchy are the great masters of surveillance capitalism, the Big Tech czars who decide in secret what ideas get promoted, what stories get suppressed. (The NatCon gospel includes great martyrdom stories, such as when Twitter and Facebook suppressed a *New York Post* story on Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop, and when various social-media companies have tried to de-platform [*The Babylon Bee*](https://archive.md/o/vtL4y/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/babylon-bee-news-kyle-mann-wokeism/620376/), the right-wing version of *The Onion*.) ‚ÄúBig Tech is malevolent. Big Tech is corrupt. Big Tech is omnipresent,‚Äù Ted Cruz roared.

In the NatCon worldview, the profiteers of surveillance capitalism see all and control all. Its workers, indoctrinated at elite universities, use ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù to buy off the left and to create a subservient, atomized, defenseless labor pool. ‚ÄúBig Business is not our ally,‚Äù Marco Rubio argued. ‚ÄúThey are eager culture warriors who use the language of wokeness to cover free-market capitalism.‚Äù The ‚Äúentire phalanx of Big Business has gone hard left,‚Äù Cruz said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen Big Business, the Fortune 500, becoming the economic enforcers of the hard left. Name five Fortune 500 CEOs who are even remotely right of center.‚Äù

The idea that the left controls absolutely everything ‚Äî from your smartphone to the money supply to your third grader‚Äôs curriculum ‚Äî explains the apocalyptic tone that was the dominating emotional register of this conference. The politicians‚Äô speeches were like entries in the catastrophism Olympics:

‚ÄúThe left‚Äôs ambition is to create a world beyond belonging,‚Äù said Hawley. ‚ÄúTheir grand ambition is to deconstruct the United States of America.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe left‚Äôs attack is on America. The left hates America,‚Äù said Cruz. ‚ÄúIt is the left that is trying to use culture as a tool to destroy America.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are confronted now by a systematic effort to dismantle our society, our traditions, our economy, and our way of life,‚Äù said Rubio.

The first great project of the national conservatives is to man the barricades in the culture war. These people have certainly done their homework when it comes to cultural Marxism ‚Äî how the left has learned to dominate culture and how the right now needs to copy their techniques. If I‚Äôd had to drink a shot every time some speaker cited Herbert Marcuse or Antonio Gramsci, I‚Äôd be dead of alcohol poisoning.

Hawley delivered a classic culture-war speech defending manhood and masculinity: ‚ÄúThe deconstruction of America depends on the deconstruction of American men.‚Äù Listening to Hawley talk populist is like listening to a white progressive Upper West Sider in the 1970s try to talk jive. The words are there, but he‚Äôs trying so hard it sounds ridiculous.

Another speaker, Amanda Milius, is the daughter of John Milius, who was the screenwriter for the first two *Dirty Harry* films and *Apocalypse Now*. She grew up in L.A. and wound up in the Trump administration. She argued that America needs to get back to making self-confident movies like *The Searchers*, the 1956 John Ford Western. This was an unapologetic movie, she asserted, about how Americans tamed the West and how Christian values got brought to ‚Äúsavage, undeveloped land.‚Äù

This is about as dumb a reading of *The Searchers* as it‚Äôs possible to imagine. The movie is actually the modern analogue to the *Oresteia*, by Aeschylus. The complex lead figure, played by John Wayne, is rendered barbaric and racist while fighting on behalf of westward pioneers. By the end, he is unfit to live in civilized society.

But we don‚Äôt exactly live in an age that acknowledges nuance. Milius distorts the movie into a brave manifesto of anti-woke truths ‚Äî and that sort of distortion has a lot of buyers among this crowd.

The first interesting debate among the NatCons is philosophical: Should we fight to preserve the classical-liberal order or is it necessary to abandon it?

Some of the speakers at the conference were in fact classical liberals, who believe in free speech, intellectual debate, and neutral government. Glenn Loury gave an impassioned speech against cancel culture, the illiberal left, and the hyper-racialized group consciousness that divides people into opposing racial camps. Loury asserted that as a Black man he is the proud inheritor of the great Western tradition: ‚ÄúTolstoy is mine! Dickens is mine! Milton, Marx, and Einstein are mine!‚Äù He declared that his people are Black, but also proudly American. ‚ÄúOur Americanness is much more important than our Blackness,‚Äù he said, before adding, ‚ÄúWe must strive to transcend racial particularism and stress universality and commonality as Americans.‚Äù This is the classical-liberal case against racial separatism and in favor of integration.

But others argued that this sort of liberalism is a luxury we cannot afford. The country is under assault from a Marxist oligarchy that wants to impose its own pseudo-religious doctrine. If you try to repulse that with pallid liberalism, with weak calls for free speech and tolerance, you‚Äôll end up getting run over by those who possess fanatical zeal, economic power, and cultural might.

Yoram Hazony, the chief intellectual architect of national conservatism, is an Orthodox Jew who went to Princeton before moving to Israel. He argues that you can‚Äôt have a society that embraces government neutrality and tries to relegate values to the private sphere. The public realm eventually eviscerates private values, especially when public communication is controlled by a small oligarchic elite. If conservatives want to stand up to the pseudo-religion of wokeism, they have to put traditional religion at the center of their political project.

Another Israeli political philosopher at the conference, Ofir Haivry, argued that Americans shouldn‚Äôt delude themselves into thinking that a nation is built out of high-minded liberal abstractions, like the Bill of Rights. A nation is, instead, a cultural tradition, a common language, a set of rituals and beliefs, and a religious order ‚Äî a collective cultural identity.

The history of Judaism demonstrates, Haivry argues, that you don‚Äôt need a state or a political order to be a nation.

For his part, Hazony argued that the American cultural identity is Christian ‚Äî and has to be if it is not going to succumb to the woke onslaught. If 80 percent [*Note: Mr. Hazony is [way off](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/)*] of Americans are Christian, Hazony reasoned, then Christian values should dominate. ‚ÄúMajority cultures have the right to establish the ruling culture, and minority cultures have the right to be decently treated,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo take the minority view and say the minority has the ability to stamp out the views of the majority ‚Äî that seems to me to be completely crazy.‚Äù

The problem in America, Hazony continued, is that LGBTQ activists today, like American Jews in the 1950s, are trying to expel Christianity from the public square. This threatens to render the public square spiritually naked. Wan liberalism collapses in the face of  left-wing cultural Marxism. ‚ÄúEliminating God and scripture in the schools . . . was the turning point in American civilization,‚Äù Hazony said. ‚ÄúAbove all else we‚Äôve got to get God and scripture back in the schools.‚Äù

Another interesting debate among the NatCons is political and economic. Conservatives have lately become expert culture warriors ‚Äî the whole [Tucker Carlson schtick](https://archive.md/o/vtL4y/https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/patriot-purge-tucker-carlson-documentary/620589/). This schtick demands that you ignore the actual suffering of the world ‚Äî the transgender kid alone in some suburban high school, the anxiety of a guy who can‚Äôt afford health care for his brother, the struggle of a Black man trying to be seen and recognized as a full human being. It‚Äôs a cynical game that treats all of life as a play for ratings, a battle for clicks, and this demands constant outrage, white-identity signaling, and the kind of absurd generalizations that Rachel Bovard used to get that room so excited.

Conservatives have got the culture-war act down. Trump was a culture-war president with almost no policy arm attached. The question conservatives at the conference were asking was how to move beyond owning the libs to effecting actual change.

Christopher Rufo, the architect of this year‚Äôs school-board-meeting protests against [critical race theory](https://archive.md/o/vtL4y/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/05/gops-critical-race-theory-fixation-explained/618828/), argued that conservatives had erred when they tried to slowly gain power in elite cultural institutions. Conservatives were never going to make headway in the Ivy League or the corporate media. Instead, Rufo argued, they should rally the masses to get state legislatures to pass laws embracing their values. That‚Äôs essentially what‚Äôs now happening across red America.

My old friend Rod Dreher of *The* *American Conservative* argued that because the left controls the commanding heights of the culture and the economy, the only institution the right has a shot at influencing is the state. In these circumstances the right *has* to use state power to promote its values. ‚ÄúWe need to quit being satisfied with owning the libs, and save our country,‚Äù Dreher said. ‚Äú**We need to unapologetically embrace the use of state power.**‚Äù [**emphasis** mine]

This is where Viktor Orb√°n comes in. It was Dreher who prompted Carlson‚Äôs controversial trip to Hungary last summer, and Hungarians were a strong presence at the National Conservatism Conference. Orb√°n, in Dreher‚Äôs view, understands the civilizational stakes of the culture war; he has, for instance, used the power of the state to limit how much transgenderism can be taught to children in schools. ‚ÄúOur team talks incessantly about how horrible wokeness is,‚Äù Dreher said at the conference. ‚ÄúOrb√°n actually does something about it.‚Äù

This is national conservatism pursued to its logical conclusion: using state power to break up and humble the big corporations and to push back against coastal cultural values. The culture war merges with the economic-class war ‚Äî and a new right emerges in which an intellectual cadre, the national conservatives, rallies the proletarian masses against the cultural/corporate elites. All your grandparents‚Äô political categories get scrambled along the way.

Will it work? Well, Donald Trump destroyed the Reagan Republican paradigm in 2016, but he didn‚Äôt exactly elucidate a new set of ideas, policies, and alliances. Trump‚Äôs devastation of the old order produced a grand struggle on the right to build a new one on Trumpian populist lines.

The NatCons are wrong to think there is a unified thing called ‚Äúthe left‚Äù that hates America. This is just the apocalyptic menace many of them had to invent in order to justify their decision to vote for Donald Trump.

They are wrong, too, to think there is a wokeist Anschluss taking over all the institutions of American life. For people who spend so much time railing about the evils of social media, they sure seem to spend an awful lot of their lives on Twitter. Ninety percent of their discourse is about the discourse. Anecdotalism was also rampant at the conference ‚Äî generalizing from three anecdotes about people who got canceled to conclude that all of American life is a woke hellscape. They need to get out more.

Furthermore, if Hazony thinks America is about to return to Christian dominance, he‚Äôs living in 1956. Evangelical Christianity has lost many millions of believers across recent decades. Secularism is surging, and white Christianity is shrinking into a rump presence in American life. America is becoming more religiously diverse every day. Christians are in no position to impose their values ‚Äî regarding same-sex marriage or anything else ‚Äî on the public square. Self-aware Christians know this.

Finally, there is something extremely off-putting about the NatCon public pose. In person, as I say, I find many of them charming, warm, and friendly. But their public posture is dominated by the psychology of threat and menace. If there was one expression of sympathy, kindness, or grace uttered from the podium in Orlando, I did not hear it. But I did hear callousness, invocations of combat, and whiffs of brutality.

One big thing the NatCons are right about is that in the Information Age, the cultural and corporate elites have merged. Right-wing parties around the world are gradually becoming working-class parties that stand against the economic interests and cultural preferences of the highly educated. Left-wing parties are now rooted in the rich metro areas and are more and more becoming an unsteady alliance between young AOC left-populists and Google.

NatCons are also probably right that conservatism is going to get a lot more statist. At the conference, Ted Cruz tried to combine culture-war conservatism with free-market economic policies ‚Äî free trade and low taxes. Marco Rubio countered by, in effect, arguing that you can‚Äôt rally cultural populists if you are not also going to do something for them economically. Cultural populism leads to economic populism. Rubio‚Äôs position at least has the virtue of being coherent.

Over the past few decades there have been various efforts to replace the Reagan Paradigm: the national-greatness conservatism of John McCain; the compassionate conservatism of George W. Bush; the Reformicon conservatism of the D.C. think tanks in the 21st century. But the Trumpian onslaught succeeded where these movements have so far fizzled because Trump understood better than they did the coalescence of the new American cultural/corporate elite and the potency of populist anger against it. Thus the display of Ivy League populism I witnessed in Orlando might well represent the alarming future of the American right: the fusing of the culture war and the class war into one epic Marxist G√∂tterd√§mmerung.

Sitting in that Orlando hotel, I found myself thinking of what I was seeing as some kind of new theme park: NatCon World, a hermetically sealed dystopian universe with its own confected thrills and chills, its own illiberal rides. I tried to console myself by noting that this NatCon theme park is the brainchild of a few isolated intellectuals with a screwy view of American politics and history. But the disconcerting reality is that America‚Äôs rarified NatCon World is just one piece of a larger illiberal populist revolt that is strong and rising.",2021-11-21 23:07:33,130

I would 100% recommend you read his post. But under the post, a commentator called Tom Stringham had this comment to how the CPC should run with an actual conservative spirit. It is perfect imo, so im quoting it, you really shouldn't miss it. 

**Quote:** 

**As far as culture, I don't see how you ""hold the line"" or ""limit the spread"" without a substantive alternative vision. That's the whole problem. Conservatives should be talking about why all our new buildings are horrific and promise to build beautiful buildings and cities again. They should propose building \*more\* statues of John A. Macdonald and other important Canadians. They should talk about restoring important norms, such as the norm against needless divorce, that have been carelessly eroded, often thanks to American influence (instead of wokeism, just call it ""contemporary American ideology""). They should criticize trashy popular entertainment for being trashy and expand the CBC and use it to produce good art everyone likes and is proud of. They should talk about banning porn, or at least age-gating it, and forcing social media onto a no-ad subscription model where it can be more easily regulated. Propose heavily taxing subscriptions to US newspapers. Talk about repealing official multiculturalism, upending the uneasy Quebec settlement that nobody is satisfied with, and working toward a coherent sense of nationhood as a people. I could keep going all day. Anyway, I don't think wokeism/successor ideology/left-modernism/whatever could compete in that environment. Put the left on the defense, the way we literally never do in Canada.**

**People know something is deeply wrong. They are desperate for someone to say structural change is needed, here is what we must do, and we will do it.**

I know for a lot of Conservatives, this is brain exploding type of stuff. But I bet you, soon as we turn into the offense instead of being the ""Anti anything the liberals do"" party. We can start getting the Canadian population on our side. Make people grateful for our countries existence, make them seek beauty in a world where is it being destroyed. Depression and suicide rates have been going up for decades. People trust each other less than ever. They have no hope.

I ask this because, in my view, it has become increasingly clear that ""conservatism"" is sort of meaningless aesthetic political word, which evokes a variety of associations in the hearer or reader but its ultimately devoid of clear or useful meaning.

Obviously this is a matter of importance, because if conservatism itself is not a valid or well-defined notion of a true type of political position, then conservative socialism is not actually a collection of *logically* related ideologies, but rather *aesthetically or impressionistically* related ideologies, which would mean that any discussion of a specifically conservative socialist action is bound to be in vain.

Left, right- conservative, liberal\*. These are all notions which have lost their utility in describing politics as it is actually vs. how it is conceived imperfectly in the minds of its participants.

179,r0s5ka,Meneltarmar,"On Churches, Conservatism and Politics","If I was a non-Christian watching news, I would suppose Churches are just Republican centers that happen to have a belief in Christ.

Fortunately, I am a Christian and I have seen multiple churches from within and that perception is wrong. Of course, there may be exceptions, but Pentecostalism is a very conservative denomination, probably one of the most, and I assist those churches.

I have not ever seen a church speaking every Sunday about political issues such abortion or gay marriage or the like as people suppose. Indeed, most oppose those things, but it is not like a political push against those things nor it is a frequent theme. In fact, **the political neutrality I find in most Churches is overwhelming, and far better than that found in supposedly neutral institutions and sources such as News or Academia.**

Ironically, **the most political churches I've seen are liberal**. They often support BLM marches, celebrate LGBT days, celebrate legalization of weed, etc. I'm not judging that as good or bad, of course.

On economics, I find even more neutrality. I have never seen a pastor complain about high taxes or free healthcare, for example. I know even some Christians that may be considered socialist. Many are left on economics and conservative on culture, which no party currently represents in America.

**TLDR**: I think most Christians are conservative, but this kind of conservationism is not as people want to believe.

187,qu5tlx,HealthMotor8651,"Have you ever read Gabriel Kolko's ""Triumph of Conservatism""? I have a couple questions regarding anti-trust regulation as a result","Hi!

I am a libertarian market socialist, I have been drifting father left over the last couple years (Trump made me a socdem, and some debates online I had over the summer made me a full on market socialist, though still very happy to work with soc dems).

One contention of a lot of progressive and soc dems is that regulated capitalism leads to good results. Unregulated capitalism and no anti-trust leads to major issues of labor exploitation, environmental destruction, etc.

I agree, capitalism has many flaws (I am a socialist after all).

  
However, I recently have been reading up on a lot of anarchist (leftist anarchism specifically, mutualism and whatnot), and I recently came across this author and book.

He is a leftist anti-capitalist historian of America in the Cold War and the Progressive era and I have been meaning to read his book (I just put a hold on it in the library, will read it when I can),

&#x200B;

According to wikipedia, he makes the following points in his book on the history of the progressive era in the United States:

 

>Kolko's thesis 'that businessmen  favored government regulation because they feared competition and  desired to forge a government‚Äìbusiness coalition' is one that is echoed  by many observers today.  
‚Äî‚ÄâEric Garris[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-antiwar1-13)  
>  
>Kolko, in particular, broke new ground with his critical history of the [Progressive Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era).  He suggested that free enterprise and competition were vibrant and  expanding during the first two decades of the 20th century; thereafter,  however, ""the corporate elite‚Äîthe [House of Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.P._Morgan_%26_Co.),  for example‚Äîturned to government intervention when it realized in the  waning 19th century that competition was too unruly to guarantee [market share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share).""[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-amcon-19) This behavior is known as [corporatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism), but Kolko dubbed it *political capitalism*, ""the merger of the economic and political structures on behalf of the greater interests of capitalism"".[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-20)  Kolko's thesis ""that businessmen favored government regulation because  they feared competition and desired to forge a government‚Äìbusiness  coalition"" is one that is echoed by many observers today.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-Cha&Lic_2000_65-18)  Former Harvard professor Paul H. Weaver uncovered the same inefficient  and bureaucratic behavior from corporations during his stint at [Ford Motor Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Corporation).[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-21) Free market economist [Murray Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard) thought highly of Kolko's work on the history of relations between big business and government.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-22) As one profile, published in [*The American Conservative*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Conservative), put it:   
>  
>For Gabriel Kolko, the enemy has always been what sociologist [Max Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber)  called ""political capitalism""‚Äîthat is, ""the accumulation of private  capital and fortunes via booty connected with politics."" In Kolko's  eyes, ""America's capacity and readiness to intervene virtually anywhere""  pose a grave danger both to the U.S. and the world. Kolko has made it  his mission to study the historical roots of how this propensity for  intervention came to be. He was also one of the first historians to take  on the regulatory state in a serious way. Kolko's landmark work, *The Triumph of Conservatism*, is an attempt to link the Progressive Era policies of [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt) to the national-security state left behind in the wake of his cousin [Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt)'s presidency. Kolko's indictment of what he calls ""conservatism"" is not aimed at the [Southern Agrarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Agrarians) of [Richard Weaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Weaver) or the [Old Right individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Right_(United_States)) of [Albert Jay Nock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Jay_Nock).  In fact, Kolko's thesis‚Äîthat big government and big business  consistently colluded to regulate small American artisans and farmers  out of existence‚Äîhas much in common with libertarian and traditionalist  critiques of the corporatist state. The ""national progressivism"" that  Kolko attacks was, in his own words, ""the defense of business against  the democratic ferment that was nascent in the states."" Coming of age in  the '50s and '60s, Kolko saw firsthand the destruction of the  ""permanent things"" as the result of the merging of Washington, D.C. and  Wall Street. A sense of place and rootedness lingers just beneath the  surface of his work.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-Hales-5)

&#x200B;

And:

>According to antiwar activist [Eric Garris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Garris),  Kolko first established his reputation as a historian writing about the  ""close connection between the government and big business throughout  the Progressive Era and the Cold War \[...\] but broke new ground with his  analysis of the corporate elite's successful defeat of the free market  by corporatism.""[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-antiwar1-13) Early in his career, beginning with his books *The Triumph of Conservatism* and *Railroads and Regulation*, Kolko used a revisionist approach as a way of analyzing history.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-GaleReference-9) Soon he was considered a leading historian of the [New Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Left),[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-14) joining [William Appleman Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Appleman_Williams) and [James Weinstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Weinstein_(author)) in advancing the so-called ""corporate liberalism"" thesis in American historiography.   
>  
>This was a thesis that disputed the ""widely held view that  government regulates business, arguing that, instead, business steers  government"",[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-GaleReference-9)  and Kolko used it to analyze how America's social, economic, and  political life was shaped beginning with the Progressive Era  (1900-1920). But for Kolko, a social policy of ""corporate liberalism""  (or what Kolko preferred to call ""political capitalism"") shaped the  mainstream agenda of all that was to follow afterwards in American  society, from [The New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Deal) (1930s) through to the post-World War II era of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War)  (1947-1962), and onwards. Kolko's argument that public policy was  shaped by ""corporate control of the liberal agenda"" (rather than the  liberal control of the corporate agenda), revised the old Progressive  Era historiography of the ""interests"" *versus* the ""people"", which was now to be reinterpreted as a *collaboration*  of ""interests"" and  ""people."" So too, with this revised version of  recent American history, came the tacit recognition that this fulfilled  the business community's unspoken, but deliberate, aim of stabilizing  competition in the ""free market.""[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-15)   
>  
>This was an idea summarized by journalist and internet columnist Charles Burris when he argued that:  
>  
>Rather  than ""the people"" being behind these ""progressive reforms"", it was the  very elite business interests themselves responsible, in an attempt to  cartelize, centralize and control what was impossible due to the  dynamics of a competitive and decentralized economy.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-16)  
>  
>In retrospect, Kolko summarized this phase of his career when he wrote that:   
>  
>""As I have argued elsewhere,  American ""progressivism"" was a part of a big business effort to attain  protection from the unpredictability of too much competition, \[See my  book *The Triumph of Conservatism: A Reinterpretation of American History, 1900-1916*, New York, 1962\].[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-17)  
>  
>Kolko argued that [big business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_business)  turned to the government for support because of its inefficiency and  inability to prevent the economy veering between boom and bust, which  aroused fears that the concomitant discontent amongst the general public  would lead to the imposition of [popular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism) constraints upon business. Its embrace of government led to their intertwinement, with business becoming the dominant strand.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-Cha&Lic_2000_65-18)

I have been underwhelmed by a lot of right wing media who honestly seem mostly like bad faith actors.   For instance, crowder and prager U  appear to be blatant grifters.   Candice Owens, Dave rubin, lauren southern, Blair white, all fail to make convincing arguments that hold up to criticism.  Stephan molenyoux, Ann coulter, and Steven bannon are unhinged.

Seeing where some of these figures I stopped paying attention to years ago support, excuse or obfuscate a violent fascist insurrection in 2021 was shocking!

One thing that still itches at me is why do so many people in the IDW balk at describing themselves as conservatives, an accurate and not particularly derogatory description of their ideology? Sure they might have liberal views on some issues here and there; pro gay marriage, pot legalisation, abortion (but not particularly worried on that front), climate change (ditto), but they devote all of their rhetorical efforts on attacking the left and bolstering right wing talking points. Why not just say that their views have changed and now they are intellectual conservatives?

After all most people on the right are happy to own that; calling themselves conservatives, Republicans etc. What is it about this small subculture of people that will agree with Tucker Carlson on pretty much everything but insist on labelling themselves as closer to who they despise; liberals and the left? I could ask this question just as easily about a leader like Jordan Peterson or one of his followers.

Is it a recruiting tactic for potential followers who come from soft-liberal backgrounds?

Public schools and teachers are also very liberal. We know how they are trying to teach libtard subjects and have gender neutral sports and bathrooms.

Corporate America are also super liberal. Their PR and CEOs try to outdo each other with their wokeness.

Almost all US cities are ran by liberals. You can tell this because they didn't stop the BLM and Antifa rioters. They refuse to address high crime and are very anti small business. They dont care about petty theft and about the homeless problem. 

Government Federal institutions like the FBI, CIA and other ABC organization are also super liberal. The ACLU said they won't be helping out rightwingers.

Pro Sports and the Liberal media are also super liberal.

Big Tech is also super liberal. 

The globalist like the UN and Nato are also a bunch of liberals. So is most of Europe. Not but liberals there.

**Picking winners and losers by rewarding preferred industries with subsidies and using government action to punish other industries.**  


One that immediately comes to mind is giving massive amounts of money to the coal industry. While also removing tax credits for green energy like wind, solar, and electric cars.  


**A disdain for different areas of the country having different laws or heterogeny.**  


Trump's attorney general Jeff Sessions trying to recriminalize legal marijuana in states that legalized it.

223,q7pajf,chiefcrunch,What do you mean by conservative? Do you want government enforced conservatism?,"I stumbled across your sub and am just curious on the ideologies here. I think a lot of the modern left's actions (in America) are driving people to the right, and they end up adopting the right's economic stances as well.  It seems like the cultural divide here also divides by economics, when that really doesn't need to be the case.

When you call yourselves conservative, is that just your personal beliefs or do you want an authoritarian government enforcing it?  If it's the former, I think there is a pretty large part of the left up for grabs in America.  I also think there are plenty of conservatives who are currently blind to the fact that capitalism contradicts a lot of their values.  They also don't realize how much of the left's policies would actually promote their values.  For example, people with strong family values would benefit from paid family leave, paid vacations, childcare credits, etc.  Elder-care, social security, and expanding Medicare to include dental vision and hearing show that society cares for its elders.

So I guess for some specific questions I have: Do you think drug users deserve a prison sentence?  Would you outlaw gay marriage?  Punishments for abortion? Make it illegal to transition genders?

If its just your personal beliefs, but you don't want to enforce them upon others, I think we could have a big tent.",2021-10-13 20:20:58,15
224,pnmeew,HazyPond292,One-nation conservatism and wealth inequality,"During Canada‚Äôs ongoing federal election, it‚Äôs been brought to attention how the Conservative leader Erin O‚ÄôToole may be trying to bring one-nation conservativism to the Conservative Party of Canada. Which has, for the past decade and a half, taken a hard right shift while embracing neoliberal economics. 

For those unaware, one-nation conservatism came about in the mid-19th century under UK Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. The ideology valued paternalism and pragmatism, and its purpose was to 1) address the issues faced by the working class due to worsening inequality, 2) reconcile the interests of all classes, and 3) to promoted the paternalist obligations of the privileged and wealthy to the poorer parts of society. It resulted in the passage of factory and health acts and greater protection of workers during Disraeli‚Äôs time. It briefly fell out of favour in favour of free market capitalism by the turn of the century, before being revived in the interwar period (1920s-30s) and remained popular until the rise of the New Right in the UK in the mid-1970s. Its since made a resurgence in the UK in the 2010s under Cameron - as a break away from the neoliberal policies of Thatcher - and has continued under Boris Johnson. 

What I‚Äôm wondering is, how effective has one nation conservatism been in addressing wealth inequality in the UK in the modern era? And how beneficial would one-nation conservatism be if was implemented elsewhere abroad to address wealth inequality?",2021-09-13 14:23:09,167

I'd like to set up a bit of context to my questions. Conservative or right-wing parties in my country have stood for the following policies, as have many parties across other Western democracies like Germany and the UK:

* lowering trade barriers like tariffs with other countries, and particularly building trade ties with China;
* raising immigrant caps and advocating for the positive role of immigrants in our society;
* campaigning for the votes of, and specifically addressing issues unique to, minority immigrant communities;
* giving land back and paying reparations to indigineous people (the last right-wing government here, which was in power when Trump was elected, reached almost sixty such settlements);
* separating church and state (for instance, our conservative Catholic Prime Minister from 2016-7 agreed with John F. Kennedy that his religion should play no role in his decisions);
* raising sales taxes;
* reducing state deficits and debt;
* banning assault rifle ownership and gun loopholes, and reclaiming them from members of the public (every member of our main conservative party voted for this in 2019);
* securing government funding for specific healthcare needs, such as mental health, pharmaceutical drugs, and care for disabled people;
* compliance with and support for closing borders, lockdowns, and other public health measures against COVID-19;
* while not party policy for our main conservative party, plenty of MPs (our equivalent of Senators), including both leaders of our two major right-wing parties, voted for legalising abortion and euthanasia.

242,qeyynd,OpeningChipmunk1700,Is conservatism fundamentally ambivalent toward institutions like academia and the media? What is their role in society?,"From participating in the sub, reading conservative pundits/authors, and engaging with conservatives generally, it seems like the movement as a whole has a bit of a split personality regarding traditional bastions of ""power"" like academia, the media, etc.

At the risk of painting exceptionally broadly, it seems like at least one strain embraces those institutions as culturally and socially significant and envision themselves (or conservatives in the institutions) as part of a larger intellectual historical channel of rigorous intellectual conservatism.

Another strain appears to view those institutions skeptically.  What is unclear to me is whether that skepticism is based on the realities of today (e.g., ""People should strive for elite colleges once those colleges jettison garbage progressivism."") or whether they reflect a more fundamental embrace of pragmatism and individualism (e.g., ""No one (literally) should waste money on elite colleges when they can get a perfectly useful degree in two years at a community college."").

&#x200B;

What exactly should the goal be regarding conservative representation in the Academy and media establishments?  It seems like at least some just want to write them off completely, but I struggle with that idea.  It seems to be tantamount to conservatives yielding influence, which is invariably followed by whining that conservatives lack influence.

ETA:  More broadly, I wonder whether education in particular poses somewhat of a self-selection problem, since academia is generally about pushing intellectual boundaries (which can be a bad thing when it involves inventing completely artificial theoretical frameworks) beyond what many conservatives would find useful/productive/advisable.",2021-10-24 14:15:26,4

It ticks all my boxes --- good art and design program. Close to home. Good education. Excellent benefits.

The one problem is that it's extremely, both theologically and politically, conservative. I'm neither liberal nor conservative overall; I'm smack in the middle. This might be because I'm an Asian American guy whose  background is mostly methodist and Presbyterian. The school is Baptist and very republican.

Is this a problem? I really,  really, REALLY like the school other than that.

Here are my concerns:

A) Is there freedom of personal theological formation? Is it a safe space to share beliefs that aren't conservative?
B) If I am outspoken in terms of different beliefs, is it possible that I could be expelled solely on that basis?
C) If their admission policy is discriminatory on any front, do they justify it through biblical means? If so, are they shooting themselves in the foot in regards to spreading the gospel to all the world?

I think that this is likely just anxiety, but considering what's been going on within the republican scene (especially regarding trumpism), are these concerns valid?

266,ph8ard,derivative_of_life,"A bunch of words about conservatism, or, how conservatives can oppose abortion, sex education & birth control, and welfare at the same time","We've all heard conservatives' favorite argument against abortion, aka ""Abortion is murder!"" Liberals accuse this argument of being disingenuous, and they're not wrong. Study after study shows that the best way to prevent abortions is comprehensive sex education and easy access to birth control. If conservatives really, truly believed that another holocaust was happening *right now* in America, wouldn't preventing it be their absolute highest priority, even if they had to make some compromises to do so? Meanwhile, the instant the kid is born, conservatives seem to stop giving a fuck about them. Not to say there aren't people out there who really, truly do believe that abortion is murder, but I think for most people, it's ultimately just an emotionally punchy argument for a position they really hold for other reasons.

So what are those other reasons? Liberals like to claim that it's because conservatives just hate/want to control women, which is where they lose the thread. According to Gallop, between 40 and 50 percent of women have consistently described themselves as pro-life. I find any argument which claims that a large group of people must hate themselves to be deeply unconvincing. 

Basically, conservatives are Hobbesians. They believe that humans are fundamentally selfish, greedy, and lazy, and that we'd much rather take things from other people that work for them ourselves. But you can't have a society where everyone is taking and no one is working. So conservatives believe the only way we can have a civilization is if people overcome their base nature through *disciple,* i.e. the ability to delay gratification. In other words, conservatives believe that civilization is a very fragile thing. Allowing or rewarding a lack of discipline is literally an existential threat to society.

When you consider things from this perspective, conservative positions suddenly make much more sense. Abortion is bad because it allows people to escape the consequences of having premarital sex, i.e. it rewards their lack of discipline. Birth control is also unacceptable for the same reasons, arguably unless you're already married with a few kids. Welfare straight-up rewards people for not working, so that's right out. Instead, they should be reliant on private charity, preferably the religious kind, so that discipline can be enforced on them until they learn it for themselves.

That's all a huge oversimplification, of course, but it captures the basics. When arguing against someone, it's essential to understand what their starting premise is.",2021-09-03 11:12:26,145

We're the inheritors of a TORY party, and the party needs to act like it. We should put less emphasis on pushing to the centre to win or right to hold onto the base, and put more effort on being what we are.

government works

it has always worked

and it continues to work

This is a fundamental saying that GOP conservatives not only disagree with but are desperate for you not to believe.. Because if people are to believe that the government work they won't support destroying the government so that corporations can take over..

Traditionally government intervention however it does work. It provides better outcomes than if there had been no government intervention at all. This is especially true in a democracy. Where the people control the government through elections.. 

And this is what gets GOP conservatives goat the most.. They HATE the idea of democracy. It's actually less that GOP conservatives hate government and more that they hate democracy.. 

The conservatives worst fear is to have a government of the People by the people and *controlled* by the people

They want policies that favor the richest Americans and hurt the poorest Americans. They want the rich to get richer off the backs of the poor. And it's very hard to do that when the American people can simply vote for things that help them instead of hurt them..

 If you're an evil person it's hard to implement your evil when people can just vote it out of office

so they have to push anti government ideology. They have to lie to the American people and create a distrust of government among the populace..

[This anti government extremism is no accident; it‚Äôs the result of a five-decades-long campaign by some of America‚Äôs richest people to tear apart the governing fabric of our nation,](https://hartmannreport.com/p/why-conservatives-want-government)

 formally kicked off by their man, Ronald Reagan, proudly proclaiming at his January 20, 1981, inauguration that, ‚Äú[G]overnment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.‚Äù

Put yourself in the place of these heirs and richest ppl in america. ,  what you would want:

- **If you don‚Äôt have to pay to dispose of cancer-causing byproducts from your refineries but can simply vent them into the air, and you make more money.**

- **If you can cut wages and threaten employees because they don‚Äôt have a union, you make more money.**

 - **If you can run a pipeline across sacred Native American land atop a major national aquifer with minimal safety oversight, you make more money.**


 - **If you can hide your money from the IRS because the agency has had its budget slashed so badly that it can no longer do expensive audits of morbidly rich people, you can keep more of the money you‚Äôve made.**

 - **If you can get the government to cut social programs and public education, thus lowering your taxes, you can keep more of the money you‚Äôve made.**

So how do you pull this off, when every one of these things hurts average Americans?

Easy. Just embark on a 50-year-long campaign, through think tanks, right-wing media, and massive PR efforts to convince average Americans that government is the cause of, not the solution to, their problems. 

Convince working-class Americans that gutting government is a good thing that will ultimately help them in some mystical, magical way through the incredible ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù of the marketplace.

Lewis Powell, a lawyer for Big Tobacco, launched the movement to do just this with his infamous memo in 1971, and billionaires have funded and promoted politicians who jump on board the ‚Äúgovernment is evil‚Äù bandwagon ever since.

Sure they will point to occasional times when the government has screwed up has usually been because of the GOP.. The GOP purposely sabotages government programs and policies so that they can claim that it doesn't work and eliminate them.. 


Just look at the post office.. 

One of the government in America's most successful Endeavors.. And the GOP tried to destroy it. They forced them to pre-fund over 75 years of Pensions for their employees. A requirement no other company or government agency ever had to do. Because it would be ridiculous.. 

The reason they did that was one reason only. They wanted to bankrupt the US Postal Service. So that they claim that the government doesn't work and defend the postal service.. And also so they could then sell it to a private company who could then become rich off of it

We'll look at other things that they point to like roads.. The GOP will purposely cut taxes and then as a result cut budgets for things like roads and schools Etc.. And then they will point to all the potholes in the roads and claimed that the government doesn't work. No. The GOP doesn't work.. The government works just fine when it's actually run by people who want to help it rather than sabotage it..


but this leads to a conundrum for the gop:


As the party of the wealthy and big business, how in the world can it convince the working class to vote for its candidates?

This is no small matter. It is not some little glitch. Rather, it is a fundamental core issue that lies at the heart of the Republican Party. It requires a grand strategy at the highest level.

The problem is simple. The GOP exists to serve the interests of the wealthy and big business that comprise the richest 1%. No party, however, can ever win an election with only 1% of the vote. So to win elections, the GOP must necessarily reach beyond its own wealthy core and attempt to convince a large segment of working people in the 99% to vote for Republicans.

But this seems impossible.

The masters at the top require the GOP to maintain policies that favor the richest 1% and disfavor the working class. So Republican policies will necessarily be profoundly unpopular to the 99%. Therefore, the GOP could never receive much more than 1% of the vote and thus could never win elections.

This is quite a conundrum.

Normally, a political party wins elections by offering policies that benefit the voters. These policies attract the voters who then cast their votes for the political party.

But for the Republican Party, this is not an option. A candidate could not possibly campaign on the policies favored by the 1%. Just imagine the stump speech. ‚ÄúVote for me and I will slash your health care! In fact, I‚Äôll do even better ‚Äî I'll fight like mad to completely eliminate your health care!‚Äù

‚ÄúVote for me and I will get rid of your pensions! This would save corporations a bundle and boost profits to the shareholders! Screw the workers!‚Äù

‚ÄúVote for me and I promise to ship your jobs overseas under globalization! The exact same labor can be hired in Asia for only pennies! Hurray!‚Äù

This, of course, is not going to work.

The Republican Party is left with only one option. It cannot possibly be honest about its true intentions and actual policies. The working class would never vote for them. Instead, the only option is to lie.

The Republican Party must lie. It has no choice. It must conceal its true inner core. This is a matter of life or death for the party. The survival of the Republican Party itself depends upon lying. It cannot exist without creating a false impression about its true purpose.",2021-11-12 07:27:12,33

I believe an alcoholic may recover if he takes inventory and shares it with another person, makes amends to those he has harmed, and tries to help others--and we may recover without the delusion of spirituality.

Of note, I found the following in the Preface to the Fourth Edition of the Big Book (published in November 2001, the Fourth Edition is AA's most current version of the Big Book):

>Because this book has become the basic text for our Society and has helped such large numbers of alcoholic men and women to recovery, there exists strong sentiment against any radical changes being made in it.  Therefore, the first portion of this volume, describing the A.A. recovery program, has been left untouched in the course of revisions made for the second, third, and fourth editions.

Are to we conclude from this logic that AA may not revisit its description of the recovery program without exposing the text to ""radical changes""?  Where does this hysteria come from?  Is AA stuck in a feedback loop?  This passage leaves me with more questions than answers, frankly.

If AA refuses to open the first 164 pages of the Big Book to revision, it should at least reflect the experience of atheists/materialists who have recovered by working the program of action laid out in the steps by including one of our stories in the next edition, as this is long past due.",2021-11-27 07:10:59,1

295,qbkbo3,Subsonic17,Conservatism vs Libertarianism during the formation of our nation,"Most Conservatives claim that the founders would most likely side with conservative ideology if they were alive today. I would argue they wouldn't. All of the values set out by the founding fathers during the revolution were vastly Libertarian in nature. In the Declaration of Independence, one of the king's many violations was that he restricted immigration into the country. Libertarians believe in open borders just as the founders did while conservatives lose their minds over the thought of America becoming less caucasian. The document also states that free people have the right to dissolve or overthrow their government if it becomes tyrannical. Conservatives think that all laws should be obeyed, which is a contradiction to the intention of the founders. Laws should be implemented for the greater good of society and not as a source of revenue for the state. Just as the king did during the colonial times, our own government has declared war on our rights and has sidestepped the constitution. Excessive force, Lengthy trials, abuse of search warrants are all used to keep us in line. In truth, the United States we know today holds none of the values that it held back then. The only similarity between now and then is the name. Sure, voting Republican may slow the erosion of our rights, but they are still being negotiated away. After all, Republicans and Democrats are two wings of the same bird. The only ways to regain liberty are the outright denial of authority, Civil disobedience, and disassociation from the federal government.

Speak one language, move to the suburbs, don't travel,  focus on wealth acquisition, be very religious, be in traditional marriage relationship,  have on passport home base, owe one home, have loyalty to your nation state and see it a crucial to your identity. 

**Goals of the opposite ideology:**

Learn multiple languages, live in big cities, travel the world, focus on life experience, be an atheist, be in multiple relationships or none at all, don't believe in marriage, have multiple passports, possibly own multiple homes. See your nation state as only a temporary business partner.

**Conclusion**: Of course, there are different levels of this latter ideology, if you don't have much money you can also experience it but to get the full benefits you would have to have more wealth.",2021-10-12 09:40:02,6

303,oqynk4,newleafsauce,CMV: The premise of conservatism as a philosophy is self-defeating and logically doesn't make sense,"So conservatism as I know it is all about ""conserving traditions"" and rejecting progress. They're always wishing to take America back to a previous era's way of doing things (hence why the motto is ""Great Again""). However, change is inevitable. Change is an enduring feature of human history. It's an inescapable thing. If you attach yourself to an ideology that is about stopping change and hoping everyone will adopt the ideals of the past, you will always lose eventually. You are probably more progressive than your parents. And your parents are probably more progressive than your grandparents, and your grandparents were probably more progressive than your grandparent's parents, and so on and so forth. So this incessant need to be resistant to change seems to be a moot point and an ultimately fruitless endeavor. So much energy is put into resisting change when it could instead be used to have an open mind, and accept reasonable change and create new solutions for our current issues; instead of trying to use old, antiquated solutions in a modern context where our understanding of things are clearly different. Time bends in the direction of change and progress and has been since the dawn of recorded history.

I am a libertarian market socialist, I have been drifting father left over the last couple years (Trump made me a socdem, and some debates online I had over the summer made me a full on market socialist, though still very happy to work with soc dems).

One contention of a lot of progressive and soc dems is that regulated capitalism leads to good results. Unregulated capitalism and no anti-trust leads to major issues of labor exploitation, environmental destruction, etc.

I agree, capitalism has many flaws (I am a socialist after all).

  
However, I recently have been reading up on a lot of anarchist (leftist anarchism specifically, mutualism and whatnot), and I recently came across this author and book.

He is a leftist anti-capitalist historian of America in the Cold War and the Progressive era and I have been meaning to read his book (I just put a hold on it in the library, will read it when I can),

&#x200B;

According to wikipedia, he makes the following points in his book on the history of the progressive era in the United States:

 

>Kolko's thesis 'that businessmen  favored government regulation because they feared competition and  desired to forge a government‚Äìbusiness coalition' is one that is echoed  by many observers today.  
‚Äî‚ÄâEric Garris[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-antiwar1-13)  
>  
>Kolko, in particular, broke new ground with his critical history of the [Progressive Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era).  He suggested that free enterprise and competition were vibrant and  expanding during the first two decades of the 20th century; thereafter,  however, ""the corporate elite‚Äîthe [House of Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.P._Morgan_%26_Co.),  for example‚Äîturned to government intervention when it realized in the  waning 19th century that competition was too unruly to guarantee [market share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share).""[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-amcon-19) This behavior is known as [corporatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism), but Kolko dubbed it *political capitalism*, ""the merger of the economic and political structures on behalf of the greater interests of capitalism"".[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-20)  Kolko's thesis ""that businessmen favored government regulation because  they feared competition and desired to forge a government‚Äìbusiness  coalition"" is one that is echoed by many observers today.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-Cha&Lic_2000_65-18)  Former Harvard professor Paul H. Weaver uncovered the same inefficient  and bureaucratic behavior from corporations during his stint at [Ford Motor Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Corporation).[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-21) Free market economist [Murray Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard) thought highly of Kolko's work on the history of relations between big business and government.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-22) As one profile, published in [*The American Conservative*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Conservative), put it:

>For Gabriel Kolko, the enemy has always been what sociologist [Max Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber)  called ""political capitalism""‚Äîthat is, ""the accumulation of private  capital and fortunes via booty connected with politics."" In Kolko's  eyes, ""America's capacity and readiness to intervene virtually anywhere""  pose a grave danger both to the U.S. and the world.

I think most of us can agree that big business has bought the government, this is one of the issues that pushed me farther left.

311,pprbet,matthedev,Wherefrom This Paranoid Style in U.S. Conservatism?,"I currently live in Missouri, and our Republican politicians like to go on these right-wing-populist screeds ([example](https://twitter.com/Eric_Schmitt/status/1438632216733564929)). They seem to have this obsession with the government having ""power"" or ""control""; their rhetoric suggests the Left/liberals/""government"" pursue acquiring power for the sake of acquiring more power‚Äîlike some kind of cartoon villain.

Despite this at least rhetorical paranoia, they persist in:

* Campaigning for the public to elect them to positions of governmental authority
* Holding office
* Exercising the levers of government power
* Fawning over the most concrete manifestations of governmental power: the police and military
* Attempting to impose their own controlling, freedom-reducing policies

One imagines they perceive a world where government officials are smashing through the doors of everyday citizens late some stormy night, strapping them down, and injecting some random substance into their bodies, cackling maniacally between thunder claps. The rest of us see something more like workplace health and safety regulations requiring people handling food to wash their hands or get vaccinated against smallpox or polio.

Where is this coming from? Isn't this the very same government we all vote for to, you know, enact laws in the interest of the common welfare, not some hostile invader bent on exploiting everything they can?

What motivates this paranoid rhetoric? From what I can tell, they and/or the primarily rural-to-exurban conservative base they're trying to speak to could be:

* Actually suffering from conditions impacting mental health: They sound paranoid because they are paranoid. Some of the fringest right-wing pundits spout ideas that sound almost schizophrenic (Alex Jones being a prominent example). Psychodynamic theorists consider frequent use of ego defense mechanisms like projection, splitting and idealization, grandiosity to be signs of borderline- or psychotic-level  personality integration/maturity.
* They have some kind of kink about being dominated (not to kink shame), and so it's always on their mind: the tyrannical government of King George III shoving its big black boot down their throat.
* They only accept the concept of negative liberty and dictates backed by their religious authorities.",2021-09-16 21:17:23,10

One contention of a lot of progressive and soc dems is that regulated capitalism leads to good results. Unregulated capitalism and no anti-trust leads to major issues of labor exploitation, environmental destruction, etc.

I agree, capitalism has many flaws (I am a socialist after all).

I think most of us can agree that big business has bought the government, this is one of the issues that pushed me farther left.

### Paternalistic conservatism is a strand of conservatism which reflects the belief that societies exist and develop organically and that members within them have obligations towards each other. There is particular emphasis on the paternalistic obligation of those who are privileged and wealthy to the poorer parts of society.

330,pvwban,Dependent-Pie-8942,How did you feel about conservatism back when republicans fought against gay marriage?,"Feel free to share your stories. 

I used to be somewhat sympathetic to the ant-gay-marriage efforts due to some christians. I‚Äôm still christian, but like most of the coming generation of conservatives I‚Äôm libertarian (aka, conservative) on social issues.

Since I wasn‚Äôt at the time old enough to vote, it was all more theoretical to me. However, I read a lot of fictional books and saw a lot of uneven power structures forcing someone to live a certain way. I also saw societal pressure force someone to live a certain way. I became very strict in my own thinking that people should not be forced but individual logic should prevail.

Additionally, when I first learned about child-bearing, it was the most disgusting thing and I didn‚Äôt think I could ever do it. Some people thought it was disgusting between two men, but I thought it was disgusting no matter who and as such didn‚Äôt make a separation. Since gay and straight were the same, it didn‚Äôt make sense for government to separate between them.

Someone I follow called Felecia Killings calls statist republicans ‚Äòprogressive republicans‚Äô, since ‚Äòprogressive‚Äô implies big-government. As such, republicans who are against gay marriage are ‚Äòprogressive republicans‚Äô. In contrast, my social conservatism has everything to do with being against uneven power structures, just like the separation of power structures the founding fathers created. I‚Äôm trying to float this definition of ‚Äòsocially conservative‚Äô.

As such, as a social conservative, I agree with the left on some things, but not in as  loud a way. The hardest things I‚Äôve been through weren‚Äôt a consequence of being gay. It‚Äôs clear that anyone could be suicidal or going through hard things even if they‚Äôre straight white cis males, and you can‚Äôt see what someone‚Äôs going through on the surface.

\-He tweeted immediately after the 2012 election:

>‚ÄúHe lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We should have a revolution in this country!‚Äù  
>  
>‚ÄúMore votes equals a loss ‚Ä¶ revolution!‚Äù

>‚ÄúLet's fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us.‚Äù  
>  
>‚ÄúThis election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy!‚Äù

\-Said he would only accept results of 2016 election if he won

\-Said that the 2016 election was rigged in ‚Äúmany polling places‚Äù and said ""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!"" without offering any evidence.

\-Claimed the 2016 election was rigged against him, even after he won, and spent 2 years investigating alleged election fraud committed by Democrats, only to find nothing.

\-Repeatedly obstructed Mueller‚Äôs investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 election.

\-Said he was thinking about becoming president for life:

>""He's now president for life, president for life. And he's great, and look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday,""

\-At a white house gun control meeting he said:

>""I like taking guns away early, Take the guns first, go through due process second.""

\-Impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of congress

\-Attempted to pressure Ukraine and China to open criminal investigations into various conspiracy theories surrounding Joe Biden, his most likely opponent in the upcoming election, while also publicly demanding that the Department of Justice arrest him.

\-Suggested that he was sitting on compromising information about a democrat senator

>‚ÄúI happen to know some United States senators, one who is on the other side, who is pretty aggressive. I‚Äôve seen that person in very bad situations. O.K.? I‚Äôve seen that person in very, very bad situations. Somewhat compromising. And you know, I think it‚Äôs very unfair to bring up things like this.‚Äù

\-Installed a new Postmaster General without any experience to make sweeping changes to USPS causing a widespread slowdown of service months before an election where mail-in voting would be more important than ever due to a global pandemic.

\-Repeatedly told his voting base that mail-in-votes are unreliable and their votes might not be counted, with absolutely no evidence supporting these claims

\-Claimed that the 2020 election would be rigged against him without providing any evidence.

\-Had one of his lawyers draw up a memo detailing how he can still win the 2020 election if he doesn‚Äôt get enough votes by (illegally) having Mike Pence stop Joe Biden‚Äôs Certification

\-Was the first president in US history to refuse to commit to a peaceful transition of power

\-Asked his supporters in North Carolina to commit election fraud by voting for him through the mail and again in person in to ‚Äòtest the system‚Äô

\-Demanded that votes stop being counted in states where he was ahead, while at the same time calling officials in states where he was behind to pressure them to ‚Äòfind votes‚Äô

>‚ÄúI just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with saying, you know, that you‚Äôve recalculated.‚Äù

\-Falsely claimed that legally cast votes would become invalid if they were not counted before the end of election day.

\-Announced he had won hours before the vote had finished being counted.

\-Claimed that Biden winning the mail-in-ballots by a landslide was proof of election fraud, despite the fact that he spent months telling his supporters not to trust mail-in-voting.

\-Was recorded 9 separate times pressuring government officials into committing voter fraud

\-Filed over 50 lawsuits, many overseen by Judges that he chose and installed, alleging mass voter fraud with zero actual evidence, and lost every single one of them.

\-Demanded several multi-month election audits that found no evidence of mass voter fraud

\-When told by the Justice Department that their investigation found no evidence of mass election fraud, he responded ‚ÄúYou guys may not be following the internet the way I do‚Äù

\-Allegedly considered declaring martial law and bringing in the Military to redo the election in states Biden narrowly won.

\-Ordered Mike Pence to unconstitutionally stop Joe Biden‚Äôs Certification

\-Since Mike Pence refused to stop Joe Biden‚Äôs Certification, he riled up a large crowd at one of his rallies by telling them that they were there to ‚Äòstop the steal‚Äô, telling them them they needed to ‚Äúfight like hell‚Äù or else they ‚Äúwon‚Äôt have a country anymore‚Äù, and told them to march to The Capitol Building where they breached the building right on time to stop the Certification of Joe Biden

\-Tweeted support for the mob as they breached The Capitol Building and chanted about executing Mike Pence.

\-Refused to call of his mob for 4 and a half hours while they searched the Capitol Building for the Senators and Representatives

\-Eventually caved in and called off the mob with a series of tweets:

>‚ÄúI know your pain, I know you‚Äôre hurt, But you have to go home now, we have to have peace. We have to have law and order, we have to respect our great people in law and order.‚Äù '  
>  
>'These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!‚Äù

\- Impeached a second time for Inciting an Insurrection. No punishment is dealt, not because members of congress argued that he is innocent, but instead because his fellow republicans claimed there was no reason to remove The President from office when his term is about to end anyway.

\-Said that the ‚Äúreal insurrection‚Äù was when he lost the 2020 presidential election.

\-Immediately began holding political rallies and going on the campaign trail once out of office, even though he hasn‚Äôt announced his candidacy for 2024.

\-Claimed that the members of the mob, who were jailed with relatively light sentences, were ‚Äúpersecuted‚Äù and ‚Äúpolitical prisoners‚Äù

\-Repeatedly demanded that various powers in the government ‚Äòdecertify the election‚Äô and ‚Äòsay he won‚Äô

\-Explained how he lies about election polls to a crowd at CPAC 2021 saying:

>‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs bad, I just say it‚Äôs fake. If it‚Äôs good, I say, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs the most accurate poll, perhaps, ever,'‚Äù

\-Refused to cooperate with the investigation into the Capitol Riot, demanded that his former aides not comply with subpoenas issued by the investigation.

\-Told his base not to vote in 2022 or 2024 unless his baseless claims of election fraud in 2020 are ‚Äòsolved‚Äô.

After everything he did in office it is clear that Donald Trump will do whatever he can, legal or not, to give himself higher odds of winning the 2024 election. If he doesn‚Äôt win, he will plan another coup; He‚Äôll try to convince his cronies in the government to throw out the election results, and if they won‚Äôt listen, he‚Äôll send an army of his brainwashed supporters to take the country back for him. After all, why wouldn‚Äôt he do it again after getting away scot-free the first time he tried it?

Even if Donald Trump does go to Prison, it won‚Äôt stop the monster he has created. Trump turned the crazy personality-worshiping minority of the republican base into an unstoppable powerhouse by making them unafraid to be blatantly authoritarian, and their ideology spread to 1/3 of our nation. Desantis, Abbot, and every other Republican considering running for President in 2024 is trying to sell themselves as the next Trump. No matter what punishment Trump faces and however many republican traitors in power are removed, the Republican base will replace them with a million mentally-ill authoritarians who spout out the lies and conspiracies that they want to hear.

The Democrat Party has proved time and time again that they are all talk and will not take harsh actions against the Republican Party until they are absolutely forced to. They continue to try negotiating and compromising with the Republican Party in congress even though the stated goal of their party has just been nothing but obstructing anything democrats suggest since 2008. They are facing down a growing fascist and they choose to continuously give into it's demands without asking for anything in return under the guise of compromise.

Either the Republican Party gains sweeping power in the next few years and legislates away democracy to quell their base's pleas to fix the already fair election process, or they lose power and their enraged base causes a civil war because they‚Äôve been convinced that American Democracy is dead.

The United States is a walking corpse, a few years from falling into its grave, and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much of a chance that what emerges from that grave will resemble anything other than a war-torn third world nation. **It is time to leave the United States. It might feel like giving up on democracy, or abandoning your nation, but it‚Äôs time to see the writing on the wall and see that American Democracy is as good as dead. Leave now, and you and your family can bring your finances, pets, and possessions to another nation as immigrants, instead of fleeing as refugees with only what you can carry and making the perilous journey to a nation that might not even let you in.**",2021-11-05 00:50:50,2

A brief note to say if you are in Canada, don't forget we have an election to steal on Monday. 

So I was recently talking with a smart Trump voter (they do exist). This guy works in tech, hates SJWs, and so on. He was also telling me immigrants are causing 'serious problems.' I agreed with him about some of the SJW stuff but then I said this 'Do you believe market prices carry key information about the desirability of various cities' and he's like 'What do you mean' so I said 'Well why are there places in Detroit where you can buy a house for 40K?' and he's like 'Well obviously there's a lot of crime, no economic opportunity, not a lot going on culturally.'

So then I said 'Yeah so why are prices going up significantly in cities like Houston and Dallas and El Paso and Miami and Toronto and a bunch of other cities around the world with a lot of nonwhite immigrants.' (I said non-white since he never objected to European immigration). All of a sudden he's all 'Well it's not just economics, it's culture.' So I said you just agreed that market prices carry key information about overall desirability and finally he was like 'Well they will turn these places blue and then they won't be desirable anymore.' 

And he's really one of the smart ones. This is the best they've got.",2021-09-16 14:08:07,33
