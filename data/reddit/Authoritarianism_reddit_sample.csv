1,ple99p,brainsandshit,CMV: Biden’s vaccine “mandate” has a multitude of precedence. It will not send the US into some authoritarian regime.,"The Supreme Court already ruled 7-2 on the side of compulsory vaccines in 1905. The court decided that the right to individual liberty in regards to vaccination is not above the rights of the collective. This is just one case of precedence out of dozens.

[Jacobson vs. Massachusetts](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts) didn’t change the US into a big authoritarian regime. 

The Court held that ""in every well ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand"" and that ""real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own liberty, whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others.”

Massachusetts was allowed to enforce their fines on those who chose not to receive the small pox vaccine. 

People need to chill. You still have the right to not get the vaccine. They’re not even fining you like they did in 1905. You just have to get tested weekly. If your employer decides they don’t want to keep you around as a result of your refusal, that is the right of the business.",2021-09-09 23:46:13,12572
2,qamymf,realtalkthrowawa,Joe is concerned about creeping authoritarianism from the left by not the right?,"Anybody else confused on this?

I’m listening to the Michael Sullenberg episode and joe is going on and on about “we’re on the road to dictatorship” “the left wants censorship” blah blah blah.

While I agree with him, that the far radical left is crazy and should be feared, they are the FAR left. Often, they drown out reasonable conversations but they are the fringe. 

However, one of the two parties in the United States has basically given themselves over to one man, has captured the Supreme Court, and has gerrymandered tons of elections to be basically useless. The republican party has stood by trump after he tried to call the Georgia attorney general to overturn the Georgia election. They stood by him after the January 6th insurrection. 

I just can’t understand why joe can laugh off/ignore the threat of authoritarian from ONE OF THE TWO MAIN PARTIES IN THE US, but he’s shaking in his boots over a bunch of pink haired lesbians who scream at politicians over wokeness.

January 6th: “that wasn’t an insurrection, that was fucking nuts dude. The media is driving people crazy”

First and foremost, I am a libertarian. Like, teetering between radical libertarian and just regular anarchist. The economics of a situation are less important to me than how we get to the place we want to be, and whether or not that place is a libertarian society. This is taken to the extent that I don't really even like democracy except as a way build and maintain small communities. So that brings up the questions...

The rise of centrally-planned societies often comes with stochastic-terrorism. We see this throughout eastern europe with the rise of statist communism, axis powers during WW2, Asia during the mid 20th century and sporadically in other parts of the modern world. I'm not going to try to produce a straw-man and say ""communists are genocidal"", but it really does seem that way in the context of communist-state regimes. Why is that? Can it be avoided? How do we get where we want to be without hurting people or destroying the things they've worked so hard for (I live my life by the principle of non-aggression)?

I see sterilizing myself as a means of making it physically impossible for American conservatives to force me to participate in the dominant cultural paradigm which got Trump elected and almost caused democracy to collapse in the United States this past January.

I see having kids as an act of emulating the culture of the Southern United States, and all the negatives that come with it such as sprawling and uninspiring cities, loud and bombastic rhetorical mannerisms, and hospitality which composes friendly interactions on the surface and judgement for those who don't conform beneath the surface. 

On the other hand, to be childfree is to emulate the cultural values of places such as the Pacific Northwest, the Netherlands, Sweden, Vancouver, etc. All of these places are filled to the brim with progressive, educated, secular, authentic, and childfree people (especially educated, intelligent, progressive, secular, empowered, and independent women), in addition to walkable and inspiring cities. 

If Ron DeSantis, Ted Cruz, etc. were to hypothetically become president of the United States, and force Americans to procreate like Nicolae Ceaușescu did in Romania, me having a vasectomy would physically incapacitate me from complying with such a draconian measure, and there wouldn't be anything they or their Evangelical base could do about it. Maybe I get sent to prison for a decade, but that sounds like heaven compared to being forced to raise kids.

*What I saw at the National Conservatism Conference.*

[**David Brooks**](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/david-brooks/) | November 18, 2021

Rachel Bovard is one of the thousands of smart young Americans who flock to Washington each year to make a difference. She’s worked in the House and Senate for Republicans Rand Paul, Pat Toomey, and Mike Lee, was listed among the “Most Influential Women in Washington Under 35” by *National Journal*, did a stint at the Heritage Foundation, and is now policy director of the Conservative Partnership Institute, whose mission is to train, equip, and unify the conservative movement. She’s bright, cheerful, and funny, and has a side hustle as a sommelier. And, like most young people, she has absorbed the dominant ideas of her peer group.

One of the ideas she’s absorbed is that the conservatives who came before her were insufferably naive. They thought liberals and conservatives both want what’s best for America, disagreeing only on how to get there. But that’s not true, she believes. “Woke elites — increasingly the mainstream left of this country — do not want what we want,” she told the National Conservatism Conference, which was held earlier this month in a bland hotel alongside theme parks in Orlando. “What they want is to destroy us,” she said. “Not only will they use every power at their disposal to achieve their goal,” but they’ve already been doing it for years “by dominating every cultural, intellectual, and political institution.”

As she says this, the dozens of young people in her breakout session begin to vibrate in their seats. Ripples of head nodding are visible from where I sit in the back. These are the rising talents of the right — the Heritage Foundation junior staff, the Ivy League grads, the intellectual Catholics and the Orthodox Jews who have been studying Hobbes and de Tocqueville at the various young conservative fellowship programs that stretch along Acela-land. In the hallway before watching Bovard’s speech, I bumped into one of my former Yale students, who is now at McKinsey.

Bovard has the place rocking, training her sights on the true enemies, the left-wing elite: a “totalitarian cult of billionaires and bureaucrats, of privilege perpetuated by bullying, empowered by the most sophisticated surveillance and communications technologies in history, and limited only by the scruples of people who arrest rape victims’ fathers, declare math to be white supremacist, finance ethnic cleansing in western China, and who partied, a mile high, on Jeffrey Epstein’s Lolita Express.”

The atmosphere is electric. She’s giving the best synopsis of national conservatism I’ve heard at the conference we’re attending — and with flair! Progressives pretend to be the oppressed ones, she tells the crowd, “but in reality, it’s just an old boys’ club, another frat house for entitled rich kids contrived to perpetuate their unearned privilege. It’s Skull and Bones for gender-studies majors!” She finishes to a rousing ovation. People leap to their feet.

I have the sinking sensation that the thunderous sound I’m hearing is the future of the Republican Party.

When I came down to Florida for the National Conservatism Conference, I was a little concerned I’d get heckled in the hallways, or be subjected to the verbal abuse I occasionally get from Trump supporters. Judging by their rhetoric, after all, these are the fire-breathers, the hard-liners, the intellectual sharp edge of the American right.

But everyone was charming! I hung around the bar watching football each night, saw old conservative friends, and met lots of new ones, and I enjoyed them all. This is the intellectual wing of the emerging right. Many of them have spent their lives at progressive places like Princeton, New York, Hollywood, and D.C. Their bodies and careers are in the Republican coastal megalopolis — but their minds and mouths are in Trumpland. As one young man told me late one night, “We’d like to dislike Bill Kristol, but he got us all jobs.”

The movement has three distinctive strains. First, the people over 50 who have been hanging around conservative circles for decades but who have recently been radicalized by the current left. Chris Demuth, 75, was for many years president of the American Enterprise Institute, which used to be the Church of England of American conservatism, but now he’s gone populist. “NatCons are conservatives who have been mugged by reality,” he told the conference. Seventy-three-year-old Glenn Loury, a Brown University economist, was a conservative, then a progressive, and now he’s back on the right: “What has happened to public discourse about race has radicalized me.”

The second strain is made up of mid-career politicians and operatives who are learning to adapt to the age of populist rage: people like Ted Cruz (Princeton, Harvard), J. D. Vance (Yale Law), and Josh Hawley (Stanford and Yale).

The third and largest strain is [the young](https://archive.md/o/vtL4y/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/princeton-young-conservatives-trump/604192/). They grew up in the era of Facebook and MSNBC and identity politics. They went to colleges smothered by progressive sermonizing. And they reacted by running in the other direction. I disagreed with two-thirds of what I heard at this conference, but I couldn’t quite suppress the disturbing voice in my head saying, “If you were 22, maybe you’d be here too.”

The Information Age is transforming the American right. Conservatives have always inveighed against the cultural elite — the media, the universities, Hollywood. But in the Information Age, the purveyors of culture are now corporate titans. In this economy, the dominant means of economic production are cultural production. Corporate behemoths are cultural behemoths. The national conservatives thus describe a world in which the corporate elite, the media elite, the political elite, and the academic elite have all coagulated into one axis of evil, dominating every institution and controlling the channels of thought.

At the heart of this blue oligarchy are the great masters of surveillance capitalism, the Big Tech czars who decide in secret what ideas get promoted, what stories get suppressed. (The NatCon gospel includes great martyrdom stories, such as when Twitter and Facebook suppressed a *New York Post* story on Hunter Biden’s laptop, and when various social-media companies have tried to de-platform [*The Babylon Bee*](https://archive.md/o/vtL4y/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/10/babylon-bee-news-kyle-mann-wokeism/620376/), the right-wing version of *The Onion*.) “Big Tech is malevolent. Big Tech is corrupt. Big Tech is omnipresent,” Ted Cruz roared.

In the NatCon worldview, the profiteers of surveillance capitalism see all and control all. Its workers, indoctrinated at elite universities, use “wokeness” to buy off the left and to create a subservient, atomized, defenseless labor pool. “Big Business is not our ally,” Marco Rubio argued. “They are eager culture warriors who use the language of wokeness to cover free-market capitalism.” The “entire phalanx of Big Business has gone hard left,” Cruz said. “We’ve seen Big Business, the Fortune 500, becoming the economic enforcers of the hard left. Name five Fortune 500 CEOs who are even remotely right of center.”

The idea that the left controls absolutely everything — from your smartphone to the money supply to your third grader’s curriculum — explains the apocalyptic tone that was the dominating emotional register of this conference. The politicians’ speeches were like entries in the catastrophism Olympics:

“The left’s ambition is to create a world beyond belonging,” said Hawley. “Their grand ambition is to deconstruct the United States of America.”

“The left’s attack is on America. The left hates America,” said Cruz. “It is the left that is trying to use culture as a tool to destroy America.”

“We are confronted now by a systematic effort to dismantle our society, our traditions, our economy, and our way of life,” said Rubio.

The first great project of the national conservatives is to man the barricades in the culture war. These people have certainly done their homework when it comes to cultural Marxism — how the left has learned to dominate culture and how the right now needs to copy their techniques. If I’d had to drink a shot every time some speaker cited Herbert Marcuse or Antonio Gramsci, I’d be dead of alcohol poisoning.

Hawley delivered a classic culture-war speech defending manhood and masculinity: “The deconstruction of America depends on the deconstruction of American men.” Listening to Hawley talk populist is like listening to a white progressive Upper West Sider in the 1970s try to talk jive. The words are there, but he’s trying so hard it sounds ridiculous.

Another speaker, Amanda Milius, is the daughter of John Milius, who was the screenwriter for the first two *Dirty Harry* films and *Apocalypse Now*. She grew up in L.A. and wound up in the Trump administration. She argued that America needs to get back to making self-confident movies like *The Searchers*, the 1956 John Ford Western. This was an unapologetic movie, she asserted, about how Americans tamed the West and how Christian values got brought to “savage, undeveloped land.”

This is about as dumb a reading of *The Searchers* as it’s possible to imagine. The movie is actually the modern analogue to the *Oresteia*, by Aeschylus. The complex lead figure, played by John Wayne, is rendered barbaric and racist while fighting on behalf of westward pioneers. By the end, he is unfit to live in civilized society.

But we don’t exactly live in an age that acknowledges nuance. Milius distorts the movie into a brave manifesto of anti-woke truths — and that sort of distortion has a lot of buyers among this crowd.

The first interesting debate among the NatCons is philosophical: Should we fight to preserve the classical-liberal order or is it necessary to abandon it?

Some of the speakers at the conference were in fact classical liberals, who believe in free speech, intellectual debate, and neutral government. Glenn Loury gave an impassioned speech against cancel culture, the illiberal left, and the hyper-racialized group consciousness that divides people into opposing racial camps. Loury asserted that as a Black man he is the proud inheritor of the great Western tradition: “Tolstoy is mine! Dickens is mine! Milton, Marx, and Einstein are mine!” He declared that his people are Black, but also proudly American. “Our Americanness is much more important than our Blackness,” he said, before adding, “We must strive to transcend racial particularism and stress universality and commonality as Americans.” This is the classical-liberal case against racial separatism and in favor of integration.

But others argued that this sort of liberalism is a luxury we cannot afford. The country is under assault from a Marxist oligarchy that wants to impose its own pseudo-religious doctrine. If you try to repulse that with pallid liberalism, with weak calls for free speech and tolerance, you’ll end up getting run over by those who possess fanatical zeal, economic power, and cultural might.

Yoram Hazony, the chief intellectual architect of national conservatism, is an Orthodox Jew who went to Princeton before moving to Israel. He argues that you can’t have a society that embraces government neutrality and tries to relegate values to the private sphere. The public realm eventually eviscerates private values, especially when public communication is controlled by a small oligarchic elite. If conservatives want to stand up to the pseudo-religion of wokeism, they have to put traditional religion at the center of their political project.

Another Israeli political philosopher at the conference, Ofir Haivry, argued that Americans shouldn’t delude themselves into thinking that a nation is built out of high-minded liberal abstractions, like the Bill of Rights. A nation is, instead, a cultural tradition, a common language, a set of rituals and beliefs, and a religious order — a collective cultural identity.

The history of Judaism demonstrates, Haivry argues, that you don’t need a state or a political order to be a nation.

For his part, Hazony argued that the American cultural identity is Christian — and has to be if it is not going to succumb to the woke onslaught. If 80 percent [*Note: Mr. Hazony is [way off](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/)*] of Americans are Christian, Hazony reasoned, then Christian values should dominate. “Majority cultures have the right to establish the ruling culture, and minority cultures have the right to be decently treated,” he said. “To take the minority view and say the minority has the ability to stamp out the views of the majority — that seems to me to be completely crazy.”

The problem in America, Hazony continued, is that LGBTQ activists today, like American Jews in the 1950s, are trying to expel Christianity from the public square. This threatens to render the public square spiritually naked. Wan liberalism collapses in the face of  left-wing cultural Marxism. “Eliminating God and scripture in the schools . . . was the turning point in American civilization,” Hazony said. “Above all else we’ve got to get God and scripture back in the schools.”

Another interesting debate among the NatCons is political and economic. Conservatives have lately become expert culture warriors — the whole [Tucker Carlson schtick](https://archive.md/o/vtL4y/https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/patriot-purge-tucker-carlson-documentary/620589/). This schtick demands that you ignore the actual suffering of the world — the transgender kid alone in some suburban high school, the anxiety of a guy who can’t afford health care for his brother, the struggle of a Black man trying to be seen and recognized as a full human being. It’s a cynical game that treats all of life as a play for ratings, a battle for clicks, and this demands constant outrage, white-identity signaling, and the kind of absurd generalizations that Rachel Bovard used to get that room so excited.

Conservatives have got the culture-war act down. Trump was a culture-war president with almost no policy arm attached. The question conservatives at the conference were asking was how to move beyond owning the libs to effecting actual change.

Christopher Rufo, the architect of this year’s school-board-meeting protests against [critical race theory](https://archive.md/o/vtL4y/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/05/gops-critical-race-theory-fixation-explained/618828/), argued that conservatives had erred when they tried to slowly gain power in elite cultural institutions. Conservatives were never going to make headway in the Ivy League or the corporate media. Instead, Rufo argued, they should rally the masses to get state legislatures to pass laws embracing their values. That’s essentially what’s now happening across red America.

My old friend Rod Dreher of *The* *American Conservative* argued that because the left controls the commanding heights of the culture and the economy, the only institution the right has a shot at influencing is the state. In these circumstances the right *has* to use state power to promote its values. “We need to quit being satisfied with owning the libs, and save our country,” Dreher said. “**We need to unapologetically embrace the use of state power.**” [**emphasis** mine]

This is where Viktor Orbán comes in. It was Dreher who prompted Carlson’s controversial trip to Hungary last summer, and Hungarians were a strong presence at the National Conservatism Conference. Orbán, in Dreher’s view, understands the civilizational stakes of the culture war; he has, for instance, used the power of the state to limit how much transgenderism can be taught to children in schools. “Our team talks incessantly about how horrible wokeness is,” Dreher said at the conference. “Orbán actually does something about it.”

This is national conservatism pursued to its logical conclusion: using state power to break up and humble the big corporations and to push back against coastal cultural values. The culture war merges with the economic-class war — and a new right emerges in which an intellectual cadre, the national conservatives, rallies the proletarian masses against the cultural/corporate elites. All your grandparents’ political categories get scrambled along the way.

Will it work? Well, Donald Trump destroyed the Reagan Republican paradigm in 2016, but he didn’t exactly elucidate a new set of ideas, policies, and alliances. Trump’s devastation of the old order produced a grand struggle on the right to build a new one on Trumpian populist lines.

The NatCons are wrong to think there is a unified thing called “the left” that hates America. This is just the apocalyptic menace many of them had to invent in order to justify their decision to vote for Donald Trump.

They are wrong, too, to think there is a wokeist Anschluss taking over all the institutions of American life. For people who spend so much time railing about the evils of social media, they sure seem to spend an awful lot of their lives on Twitter. Ninety percent of their discourse is about the discourse. Anecdotalism was also rampant at the conference — generalizing from three anecdotes about people who got canceled to conclude that all of American life is a woke hellscape. They need to get out more.

Furthermore, if Hazony thinks America is about to return to Christian dominance, he’s living in 1956. Evangelical Christianity has lost many millions of believers across recent decades. Secularism is surging, and white Christianity is shrinking into a rump presence in American life. America is becoming more religiously diverse every day. Christians are in no position to impose their values — regarding same-sex marriage or anything else — on the public square. Self-aware Christians know this.

Finally, there is something extremely off-putting about the NatCon public pose. In person, as I say, I find many of them charming, warm, and friendly. But their public posture is dominated by the psychology of threat and menace. If there was one expression of sympathy, kindness, or grace uttered from the podium in Orlando, I did not hear it. But I did hear callousness, invocations of combat, and whiffs of brutality.

One big thing the NatCons are right about is that in the Information Age, the cultural and corporate elites have merged. Right-wing parties around the world are gradually becoming working-class parties that stand against the economic interests and cultural preferences of the highly educated. Left-wing parties are now rooted in the rich metro areas and are more and more becoming an unsteady alliance between young AOC left-populists and Google.

NatCons are also probably right that conservatism is going to get a lot more statist. At the conference, Ted Cruz tried to combine culture-war conservatism with free-market economic policies — free trade and low taxes. Marco Rubio countered by, in effect, arguing that you can’t rally cultural populists if you are not also going to do something for them economically. Cultural populism leads to economic populism. Rubio’s position at least has the virtue of being coherent.

Over the past few decades there have been various efforts to replace the Reagan Paradigm: the national-greatness conservatism of John McCain; the compassionate conservatism of George W. Bush; the Reformicon conservatism of the D.C. think tanks in the 21st century. But the Trumpian onslaught succeeded where these movements have so far fizzled because Trump understood better than they did the coalescence of the new American cultural/corporate elite and the potency of populist anger against it. Thus the display of Ivy League populism I witnessed in Orlando might well represent the alarming future of the American right: the fusing of the culture war and the class war into one epic Marxist Götterdämmerung.

Sitting in that Orlando hotel, I found myself thinking of what I was seeing as some kind of new theme park: NatCon World, a hermetically sealed dystopian universe with its own confected thrills and chills, its own illiberal rides. I tried to console myself by noting that this NatCon theme park is the brainchild of a few isolated intellectuals with a screwy view of American politics and history. But the disconcerting reality is that America’s rarified NatCon World is just one piece of a larger illiberal populist revolt that is strong and rising.",2021-11-21 23:07:33,129

Cycling, and all that was associated with it always seemed so cool to me.
The teams sponsors have definitely had an influence on me. 
Products and brands like soudal silicon, Sky TV, oakleys and skoda seem more attractive to me because of their association with one of my favourite sports. Obviously, this is the power of advertisement, and the reason why companies pay millions to have their brands slapped on barriers and jerseys. 

I have recently felt concerned, and perhaps a bit uneasy at the apparent rise of companies and countries that could be described as unethical, plastering their brand all over cycling. 

I think for me this has really hit home with Pogacar. He’s the same age as me (unfortunately the only numbers we share lol) and rides proudly with a UEA badge plastered on his jersey. 
The UAE is a deeply authoritarian state. Being gay is illegal. The only requirement for consent is marriage. The people there are censored and don’t have access to free information. The list goes on. 

I also find it truly bizarre that one of the biggest teams in cycling, a pastime which is environmentally friendly at its core, is sponsored by a great big gas-guzzling 4x4- produced by a chemicals company whose plant in Scotland is the greatest pollutant in the country.

I don’t place any blame on the riders of these teams, but it does make me wonder, or perhaps jaded as to where the sports priorities are.

I suspect it has something to do with not offending authoritarian sensibilities, or that authoritarianism is just so prevalent that if we acknowledged it as emotional abuse we'd have to reckon with the normalization of emotional abuse in our culture (I'm speaking as someone from the U.S./North America).

People there are not allowed to leave their home without explicit permission, protests are effectively banned, people are forced to report on their location through an app, the military is enforcing these laws, etc. I'm by far not a covid conspiracist, let me make that clear, but what is happening right now in Australia is really going beyond what it is necessairy. So much so, that some people are starting to question whether it should still be classified as a liberal democracy...

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/pandemic-australia-still-liberal-democracy/619940/

>>Before 2020, the idea of Australia all but forbidding its citizens from leaving the country, a restriction associated with Communist regimes, was unthinkable. Today, it is a widely accepted policy. “Australia’s borders are currently closed and international travel from Australia remains strictly controlled to help prevent the spread of COVID-19,” a government website declares. “International travel from Australia is only available if you are exempt or you have been granted an individual exemption.” The rule is enforced despite assurances on another government website, dedicated to setting forth Australia’s human-rights-treaty obligations, that the freedom to leave a country “cannot be made dependent on establishing a purpose or reason for leaving.”

>>Intrastate travel within Australia is also severely restricted. And the government of South Australia, one of the country’s six states, developed and is now testing an app as Orwellian as any in the free world to enforce its quarantine rules. Returning travelers quarantining at home will be forced to download an app that combines facial recognition and geolocation. The state will text them at random times, and thereafter they will have 15 minutes to take a picture of their face in the location where they are supposed to be. Should they fail, the local police department will be sent to follow up in person. “We don’t tell them how often or when, on a random basis they have to reply within 15 minutes,” Premier Steven Marshall explained. “I think every South Australian should feel pretty proud that we are the national pilot for the home-based quarantine app.”

>>In New South Wales, Police Minister David Elliott defended the deployment of the Australian military to enforce lockdowns, telling the BBC that some residents of the state thought “the rules didn’t apply to them.” In Sydney, where more than 5 million people have been in lockdown for more than two months, and Melbourne, the country’s second-biggest city, anti-lockdown protests were banned, and when dissenters gathered anyway, hundreds were arrested and fined, Reuters reported.

What is even scarier, which many people may not have thought of as anything significant, is the recent AUKUS pact, a military alliance between Australia, the UK and the US, whereby Australia is going to receive about 6 **nuclear powered submarines**, which would make it have the largest fleet of them in the world I believe. This has further been accompanied by war-like language, which further tells me that Australia is preparing itself to get into a war. With, ofcourse, China. Just listen to this [Australian news programme ""60 minutes""](https://youtu.be/kA2KaEKs1LA) with the language these people are using. This is official Australian media. 

This all makes it very clear to me that the tide of liberal democracy (so far as you believe in liberal democracy, which I dont anyways) is going away and being replaced by authoritarian capitalism, complete with police state and a lust for war. What do you guys think? Are these concerns overexagerated... or are we entering scary times?

Call me neoliberal if you want but the farm laws were absolutely the step in the right direction. In fact, I'm almost blackpilled that most people were against it only because BJP were the ones who introduced the laws. I'm convinced no one in this country really gives a shit about the working class and it is just team sports and in that regard, it is actually sad that one good policy decision after so much of a shit show led to nowhere.

This lies squarely on the feet of the fear mongering the left did around the issue helped by the undemocratic fashion the bill was introduced in the parliament. In fact, over the one year the issue has been used as a wedge to communalize people and pitch Hindu communities against the Sikhs. Whether it's resurfacing of the Khalistani narrative, attacking on the Indian republic, or open murder. It felt less of a protest about farm laws and more as a narrative to oust BJP in the next election cycle. 

Why Modi didn't force in through? Because as much as people like to caricature him as this fascist neo nazi monarch, he is actually an image conscious opportunist... and this is how democracy is supposed to work. If you have a section of people who are absolutely convinced that passing certain laws will have their lives destroyed by some capitalist RSS boogeyman and they are getting targeted for being rich Sikhs, there is no way in hell a democratic government can go ahead with this. And it makes no sense to sit on the issue and let the whole thing used as tool to further communalize people. I personal think it was good thing, that instead of putting this on back burner, they decided to take a decision. I'm not happy with the decision, but I couldn't see how else they could pass this without being called spitting image of Hitler.

Also, ever since Amit Shah had COIVD last year, I personally think the toxic Hindu appeasing narrative of BJP has shimmered down quite a lot. Bengal election, that AMU speech, pandering to Muslims in UP elections... it's just the way I feel. Looks like if you have enough people talking about an issue and the whole thing gets highlighted in international circles, BJP are willing to lick their own vomit, quite unheard of a ""fascist"" government.  This also highlights the hidden power levels of the ""left"" media. They are not as helpless as they want you to think, especially when they are the ones controlling the narrative around the India in the world.

91,qid3n0,civicsfactor,"Instead of collapse, governments might just opt for dystopian authoritarianism because it's the path of least resistance for a crop of politicians, billionaires, and other elites weaned on a poisonous political culture","This is their adaptation.

Governments fail all the time throughout history, but our history books compress what took decades to mere sentences.

The key difference is human technology has evolved so much, surpassing the systems of human decision-making needed to keep growth and exploitation with sustainable bounds.

We're not wired for engaging in a democracy with the long-term interests of society in mind and heart. 

The last 50 years saw boundless leaps in marketing and political psychology as well, doubtlessly employed on the masses to win elections and ultimately, continue populating a system of group decision-making with people grown in the same Cold War culture of demonizing the left even when they have a point.

We've made environmentalism so effeminate and associated with ""the other side"" that when our problems need credit where it's due in order to solve we've handicapped ourselves.

Which means the world gets worse.

If government fails, there's a chance something better could spring forward or take root. There's an inherent hopefulness to preppers and homesteading and permaculture.

If society fails its not the end of the world.

But the ecosystem only has to fail once for cascading effects to be felt throughout.

And how governments adapt will mean all the corrupt ideas and perverted hypocritical values circulating in the elites' minds will respond to collapse with more dystopia.

I think dystopia is a lot more sustainable than we give it credit for.

I don't care what we call it, but our system of group decision-making needs healing. I put a lot of research time interviewing experts on democratic reform, so I err on the side of democracy as the best/least worst form of decision-making and choosing leaders.

And the simplest I've boiled it down to is if we want better leaders we need better voters. If we want evidence-based decision-making we need an evidence-based democracy.

That means asking ourselves about the ecosystem of a healthy democracy, asking ourselves how it is we train citizens to constructively disagree and collectively choose good leaders and filter out bad. How it is our media operates, is funded, informs people and reports controversies. And how it is that political parties compete for votes and what healthy competition versus unhealthy looks like.



TLDR: we think preventing collapse is political suicide and that's why things will collapse. But just maybe, fixing democracy is suicide and thats why dystopia will be the preference of elites over collapse.",2021-10-29 08:42:11,705

104,qrgnfr,FearlessSon,Authoritarianism and its Intersection with Men’s Issues,"I reached out to the mods here a few weeks ago with a proposition that I write a post about authoritarianism, since a lot of comments here wondering about things I felt could be explained by an understanding of an authoritarian mentality. Such a thing would have required too much explanation for a comment, so I wanted to make sure the mods were okay with a post about it. They said that sounded fine, provided I include some details about how I think it intersects with men's issues.

I went and wrote it, but it turned out to be a bit too long to fit in a Reddit post, so I ended up publishing it as a medium post, which I can link here:

This is mostly a brief primer of what authoritarianism is as bit of social psychology, and I conclude it with several ways I think it becomes a factor in issues of interest to this sub. I mostly wanted to socialize this information to the community, because I think it can be pointed back to as part of replies trying to explain something, and it should contain the necessary context for someone new to understand what that explanation is referring to.

In particular, if anyone has experienced things similar to the phenomena I've described here, I'd appreciate it if you would share how that applied to you. It helps to make the understanding more concrete if we know someone who's experience was shaped in some way by it.",2021-11-11 02:25:53,461

We have contested Australian elections since 2012 but also advocate for technology, civil rights and digital liberties more broadly. Some of our notable achievements include 

* A 2010 Sydney workshop to assist individuals seeking safe methods of euthanasia to get around Labor's internet firewall, which attempted to block it

* The broad base Queensland 2013/2014 campaign against the Liberals attempt to outlaw bikie clubs with mixed opposition by Labor. 

* Our 2017 and 2018 panels at PaxAus on copyright in game design

* Numerous submissions to government inquiries over the years, most notably copyright, privacy and the right to repair. 

Feel free to ask us about the recent increase in authoritarianism in Australia, recent legislation, the efforts by Labor and Liberal parties to disqualify minor parties from elections, technology enabled direct democracy, copyright and the right to repair, cryptocurrency, and more!

In the last couple of months:

The online safety bill was passed making the eSafety commissioner the sole arbiter of internet content in Australia. Because, of course It’s about cyber bullying... it won’t end up being  about internet censorship at all.

Political discussions were had of a social credit system for social media users, in order to combat “online abuse”, involving necessary “passport” style verification for profiles.

The identify and disrupt bill was passed, giving police the right to obtain, delete and modify your data for the purpose of preventing “serious and organised” crime. Because... It’s not like they will use that to prevent protests. And if they do, “it’s only because of the covid risk”. 

Because remember, this will absolutely be the one time in history that these sorts of powers will not be abused. Because well.. the government said so, and they probably mean well. 

I don’t want to live in this country anymore.  But I’m not allowed to leave. In fact, I can’t even leave my apartment after 9pm.

Not just the lockdowns & mandates, but the exact same attitudes towards vaccinated vs unvaccinated, ""covid disinformation"", etc.

In the US, UK, France, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, etc... you are seeing:

* **Increasingly strict Vaccine Passport laws, regardless of data and vaccination rates**
   * In parts of Australia and the US, there's outlandish displays of police brutality towards ordinary citizens doing literally nothing
   * New Zealand and Australia would lockdown over single-digit cases. Why???
* **Universal demonization of ""the unvaccinated"" from politicians and the media**
   * threat of job removal and ""losing your freedoms""
   * deaths among the vaccinated are underplayed or, without irony, blamed on the unvaccinated
* **Dismissiveness towards a crumbling economy**
   * there doesn't seem to be any significant response to the global Supply Chain crisis
   * energy prices are skyrocketing (at least in Italy and US). The only response was Sen Schumer telling his constituents to choose between food & heat this winter...
   * US gov't is ignoring the near-hyperinflation that's happening on the World's reserve currency
   * mass firings GLOBALLY during a time of much needed economic recovery -- what???
* **And lastly... China-style censorship in every other ""free country""**
   * Anything that questions authority is labeled ""Covid misinformation"". **Once-obvious facts** like ""natural immunity"" immediately get censored.  If the State says 2+2=5, then you're cancelled for saying 4.
   * **Complete media** **blackout** of the thousands of protestors against vaccine mandates-- seemingly in every country this is happening. Some just outright lie about the existence or reasons behind these protests (e.g. Southwest's ""weather problems"")
   * Incredibly in-your-face Double Speak about why the vaccine isn't working. (The vaccine prevents death from Covid. But if you're unvaccinated, you're threatening the lives of the vaccinated.)
   * Increased censorship towards criticisms against politicians & bureaucrats. (Praise Fauci, MBUH)
      * At this point... if you can't criticize the gov't, what's the point of having a ""free press""?

Of course, some of these points apply to some countries more than others. But generally speaking, every other Western nation is practicing this same standard of Fascism. Is this actually happening, or am I just reading too much Covid misinformation?",2021-10-19 16:37:45,324

184,qchu62,proto642,Anyone else feeling properly disturbed by the latent authoritarianism that's been roused within our country's population?,"So this is admittedly anecdotal, but most of the people I've spoken to recently are in favour of vaccine mandates. I recently had a talk with my older sister about it, who happens to also be a journalist. I'll provide a very brief run down of that conversation in what follows, along with some of my own thoughts.

When discussing whether or not vaccine mandates are justified, my sister blatantly stated that the ""greater good"" should always supersede *any and all* individual human rights, without exception. After picking my partially disintegrated jaw up off the floor, I decided to mention the right to freedom of expression, thinking that it may help her to see the dangerous consequences of her stated position...she's a journalist, after all. But guess what? ""Oh my goodness, of *course* I don't believe in free speech! It can cause lots of harm to people!"" was the response I received.

I am at a loss. This woman is my sister and I love her, but she's also a journalist. The fact that *journalists*, of all people, don't believe in human rights - most notably the right to freedom of expression - is deeply worrying to me. Our country's collective psyche is being shaped by rabid authoritarians, both in government and in media, and the masses are lapping it up like good little lapdogs. Admittedly I already knew that my sister was a raging communist, but I'm seeing similar sentiments echoed all over the place at a rate I've never witnessed before. The media is partly to blame for this.

Anyways...according to NZ law, we already do not have a right of freedom of speech. That ship sailed a long time ago. However, if this kind of ideology continues to promulgate, I fear that such concepts themselves (including ""medical autonomy"") will be totally defunct and have zero cultural weight behind them in the near future. They already seem to have very little.

190,pz452p,Berningforchange,"Vaccine Mandates are coercive, illegal, immoral and unethical. Informed consent requires a decision by the patient not an authoritarian edict.","Mandates ordering people to get an experimental covid vaccine with known side effects and questionable efficacy is the height of authoritarianism. 

A fundamental principle of medical ethics and democracy is that people have a right to control their own bodies. Examples of this are common knowledge but seem to have been forgotten and are being ignored. 

- No one can kidnap a person or lay hands on a person without consent. 

- Minors cannot give anyone the right to perform medical procedures on them. 

- Individuals lacking capacity cannot give consent without authorization from a court or a guardian of that person. For example people with dementia cannot consent. 

- Consent cannot be coerced. For example, in general, prisoners can’t give consent to medical experimentation. 



I encourage people to read this [Informed Consent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430827/) paper. 

[This journal article lays out the principles of informed consent in a clear and concise way.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430827/)

>**Informed consent is both an ethical and legal obligation of medical practitioners in the US and originates from the patient's right to direct what happens to their body**. Implicit in providing informed consent is an assessment of the patient's understanding, rendering an actual recommendation, and documentation of the process. The Joint Commission requires documentation of all the elements of informed consent ""in a form, progress notes or elsewhere in the record."" 

>The following are the required elements for documentation of the informed consent discussion:

> (1) the nature of the procedure,
> (2) the risks and benefits and the procedure, 
>(3) reasonable alternatives, 
>(4) risks and benefits of alternatives, and
> (5) assessment of the patient's understanding of elements 1 through 4.

>**It is the obligation of the provider to make it clear that the patient is participating in the decision-making process and avoid making the patient feel forced to agree to with the provider**. The provider must make a recommendation and provide their reasoning for said recommendation.

Emphasis added. 

People are welcome to get vaccinated.  That is their choice. Getiing 2 shots, a booster, getting vaccinated twice a year, whatever the person and their doctor agree to is fine. It’s a personal choice and as long as it’s informed, consensual and medically necessary it is completely none of my business or anyone else’s. 

Forcing people to get vaccines on the other hand cannot be tolerated. Coercing people to get vaccines is unacceptable and also cannot be tolerated. Preying on minors who are not able to give consent for medical procedures cannot be tolerated. 


This has to stop. 

Now before someone makes the specious claim that this is about public health and the government has the authority to mandate vaccines I want to be quite clear that this is categorically not true. 

- First, there is no state of continuing emergency that would allow this authority to be used. Whether or not there ever was a true state of emergency that should have allowed the circumvention of constitutional principles, legal precedent, laws and normal medical and ethical standards is moot at this point. What is a fact is that the COVID 19 state of emergency that was declared by governors has expired in all states and democratic norms now apply. Vaccine mandates do not conform with these norms.  

- Second, Covid 19 vaccines are not at all like commonly accepted childhood vaccines for serious diseases like polio, small pox measles, etc… that are required to enter school. A few reasons for this distinction: C19 is an illness not a disease, the C19 vaccine is new and still in clinical trials, C19 vaccine does not prevent infection with covid, C19 vaccine does not prevent the transmission of covid, C19 has a 99%+ survival rate for most people. 

- Third, the smallpox Supreme Court case that the vaccine-only mandate advocates rely on is inapplicable for federal mandates. It is a case about a serious disease that kills around 40% of unvaccinated people. But most importantly it is a city order about preventing people on an international ship from entering the city during an actual emergency without providing proof of vaccination. That fact pattern isn’t even close to a federal mandate for a C19 vaccine or you lose your rights and lose your job. 

- Fourth, reasonable alternatives are *not* being offered. Anti-virals, treatment, preventative measures are not being offered as an alternative to C19 vaccines. Examples of alternatives would also include: encouraging people to stop smoking, encouraging obese people to lose weight, preventing and treating underlying medical conditions that are co-morbidities for C19, encouraging exercise, rest, multivitamins, taking special care with vulnerable populations, etc…

Here are a few examples of cases where autonomy and bodily integrity are incontrovertible: 

- A woman has a right to choose what happens with her body. 

- A child should not be psychologically or physically harmed 

- Police officers should not assault citizens 

- Prison guards should not physically assault prisoners

It makes no sense for anyone who believes these examples are valid to advocate for forced C19 vaccinations. Perhaps people have not thought it through, and I encourage them to do so in a rational manner. Forced C19 vaccinations should not be normalized because they are not consensual or ethical. For those who continue to cling to and support forced vaccinations the only explanations for endorsing such a tyrannical intrusion on people’s rights is in my opinion either complete brainwashing, callousness, or mass psychosis (watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M))

This madness must stop. Mandates must not be used and people vaccinated or unvaccinated must stand up and defend the right of people to control their own bodies and make their own decisions about their health in a private way in consultation with their personal physician.",2021-10-01 04:05:34,509

I also dislike the shepherd aspect of Christianity. I like the teachings of Jesus about peace and humility, but dang his father is egocentric.

Never mind experiencing or discovering things on your own, or even with his help: you must follow the herd and stay defenseless and at his mercy forever.

14. Economy protectionist
15. Increased the use of the death penalty at the end of his term

This “libertarian” went on to say he himself supports all these policies, claiming none of them are authoritarian. He proceeded to justify the death penalty with “they’re criminals. They don’t deserve to live” and the travel ban with “those people pose a threat to us.” He did go on to justify illegal drugs as well and each one of those policies. I asked him how that would make either him or Trump small government or libertarian, to which he responded “I don’t need to explain myself. If you would take a basic economics class you would understand the stuff Trump did was genius.”

So yeah, this just reminded me of so many neocons who call themselves libertarians. Why do they do that exactly? How do you guys feel about them?",2021-10-24 09:01:22,68

Most coins are down anywhere from 15 to 25%. Altcoins have been impacted the most. Even stablecoins have crashed 10% as people are selling that for INR.

Modi has show to be an incompetent ruler, just this week he rolled back farm laws that seeked to destroy farmers livelihood in favour of his industrial buddies who fund his election campaign. Over 100 farmers died due to protests across the country, and then Modi meekly rolled back the laws.

Now he is attacking crypto and seeking to shut this market down.

261,qy9dw3,opposite_locksmith,Common Sense Seems to Dictate That Announcing Fuel Rationing Was a Mistake,"I may be completely wrong and if I am, please correct me.  I am not an expert in this field, although I do have a minor in Economics so I am qualified to vaguely predict the aggregate demand curve for a spherical cow in a vacuum.

I think the government would have been far better off to make a mainstream and social media campaign to encourage people to voluntarily reduce their fuel consumption or postpone fuel purchases to make it available to first responders and essential services.  From the recent pandemic, we know that a majority of people (maybe 60-70%?) will want to do the right thing and will make small changes for the greater good if asked.

A large minority (maybe 20-30%?) will continue to act as they did before because they don't care, and a small minority will go batshit crazy, but that last group can't be reached by their own families so expecting the government to get through to them is a waste of resources.

**Announcing a fuel ration can only make things worse for two reasons:**

1. It induces demand by creating the perception of a shortage or emergency.  Thousands and thousands of people with 1/2 or 3/4 tanks were not planning on getting gas yesterday morning, but after hearing the announcement you can bet they changed their mind and started lining up at the gas stations.
2. The ration is too high to meaningfully preserve supply - Unless you daily drive an excavator, you aren't averaging 30 litres a day in gas purchases.  Hell, I drove to the Okanagan and back last weekend    in my Cayenne and I don't think averaged 30 litres/day *on a road trip*.

Bottom line, nobody can use 30 litres a day, but it is possible to buy 30 litres/day  so that legal maximum is now the minimum for people who won't break the law, and for that selfish minority, they will feel justified in finding (what they think are) clever ways to buy more than they are allowed.  This is what creates an actual, dangerous shortage.

**I am willing to bet that for the next week, daily fuel purchases in the province (but not consumption!) will actually increase.**

Unfortunately, I think this announcement was made by a group of people with no expertise and little common sense who wanted to be seen to take some action.  But, there is an easy scape goat for the fuel shortages:  hoarders.

It would have been more effective to either start a ""soft"" voluntary campaign to reduce consumption and thereby purchases because nobody is panicking and most people are actually using less... or...

setting a limit that is below the actual daily consumption like 10 litres, and having it enforced.  This would be an actual nightmare and probably lead to violence and would be politically damaging so I am not in favour of this method unless it's a blockbuster movie type disaster.  

  

**TL:DR  The fuel ration makes things worse because it fails to recognize that daily fuel consumption and daily fuel purchases are different issues.  The ration scares people into increasing their fuel purchases but does nothing to reduce consumption.**",2021-11-20 10:42:44,901

I think it's mostly clear his revolution against Batista was justified, what I'm more curious about is your take on his later life when Cubans were strangled by the US embargo and many were so sick and tired of it that it was normal to escape to Florida. I feel like people point to this period and claim ""communism equals poor"" but to me it looks more like they actually did fairly well for the most part in spite of the US's efforts to strangle them and force them to fail. They literally isolated Cuba from the entire world, didn't allow them to trade with anyone. It's amazing they've done as well as they have. There was a disparity between rich and poor (although I'm not sure if it's as big a gap as in modern day US) but they also have some of the highest rates of health professionals and educators. I sometimes wonder how well Cuba could have done if they were able to maintain open trade relations with US and other countries. I think the notion ""communism = poor"" would be completely unbelievable. I also have been discussing Cuba's government controlled media network which rubs me a little bit the wrong way (check my comment history). I don't see why this piece is necessary, it seems like if your administration is strong and ethical, you should welcome criticism from independent news sources. This piece smells to me like dictatorship. Other people on Reddit have pointed to the alternative which is corporate controlled media we have in the US, but at least we can also listen to completely independent sources without the government labeling them as illegal or enemies of the state (even if they are).

My ex tried to lie and say he hadn’t and that we had plan things together. I scoffed and said that he had been a dictator the entire time and I was going to have a smaller party with my family at a later date, so our son knew at least one of us realised his birthday was about him and not about us. My ex was pissed. It didn’t help that his parents got on his case about being a dictator.

A world free of criticism is not a happy one, but a dystopian and hopeless one.","“When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.” - George R.

“If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.” - George Orwell.

People live a larger and larger portion of their lives online, and there is this very strange belief that social media companies, and now YouTube, seem to be conveying that if you have an opinion different from what is considered ‘correct’ - you are not allowed to express it. And worse, you’re being considered radical for even attempting to hold it. 

This decision to remove the like bar is not for the protection of small creators, it is for the protection of corporations and large creators that do not want to have the dislike for their video content publicized. 

I have come across so many fake videos on YouTube that are scams or purposely misleading, and the dislike bar helps people recognize that. It gives the people a platform to express their own opinion appropriately. 

Google will attempt to justify this as “for your protection” and “for the befit of the little creators” as a way to hide the fact that this is a good way to promote only the content they want people to see through their algorithms, and prevent anyone from being criticized even when the people have an opinion different then what is being expressed.

319,r1zo9j,Bedheadforlife,UPDATE: Dictator Dad Tried Controlling Thanksgiving So I Said No Thanks,"Link to the previous post.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Justnofil/comments/r0mip6/jnfil\_wanted\_to\_control\_thanksgiving\_so\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justnofil/comments/r0mip6/jnfil_wanted_to_control_thanksgiving_so_i/)

TLDR; JNFIL (who I will now call Dictator Dad) would not let us make any of our own decisions for Thanksgiving and decided that everyone will be eating takeout Thanksgiving dinners and are not allowed to participate in anything or be consulted in things that regard us, and I was completely left out, so I un-invited myself.

THANK YOU EVERYONE, for your input in my original post, it absolutely helped me justify my decision and there were so many amazing tips that helped us eventually decide on our ""Plan B"" holiday. I truly appreciate the support. This is a totally new situation for me to navigate as I've never had JustNoIL's before.

UPDATE TIME!

Things turned into a HUGE tug-of-war since my previous post, and my stress shot through the roof. I have an autoimmune disease, and stress is extremely hard on my body. I'm currently swaddled in a heating pad as I'm having a huge Hashimoto's flare-up which has been agonizing (my joints feel like they are on fire). Not how I wanted to spend my Thanksgiving, but here we are. I decided last night that I'm not going to let this stress continue and that until Dictator Dad can be respectful of both me and his son, I will not be participating in any family activities and that is that. Honestly, it's a relief.

I am SO PROUD of my BF. He called his mom, who I initially thought might be just a MildlyNoMIL, but boy was I wrong! He explained to her that I will not be attending because they did not include me or him and completely messed everything up. She was LIVID. She went into a rage saying that I am ungrateful and everything they did was for ME. Is she freaking SENILE?

She said, ""We KNEW that Bedheadforlife was deathly ill and we did all of this to take the burden off HER shoulders. She should be grateful we invited her."" ....uhhhh wow.

Okay, for one. I am not deathly ill. I'm not even sick. I was sick with a cold \*two weeks ago\* (which they knew about). I think they completely used that fact to manipulate the situation in their favor and to look like ""good people"".

My BF was livid and continued to explain that they should have called me and asked if I felt up for it instead of just deciding I was ""sick"" since he and I had already planned something and I would have obviously spoken up for myself if I was unable to make it happen. He also stated that he had expressed to his dad what we wanted to do and was completely shut down. Again, she kept throwing out the same excuses and throwing the biggest tantrum ever. She had nothing nice to say about me, but my BF stayed firm.

So, at least I now know how MIL is early on.

BF and I decided to have our own Thanksgiving by ourselves at home. It won't really be very homemade, I got some things that I could just stick in the oven or quickly put together, but from the fancy grocery store so at least it will be higher quality and I can dress it up a bit. We thought it would be fun to do something different and got a Turducken for the hell of it. I sent him a picture of everything I picked out and he was immensely happy and excited that he wasn't stuck eating takeout. His parents stated that they were eating around noon or 1 pm, so my BF said that he would stop by to visit for an hour, stand up for us, have a couple of bites, then come home and have the special holiday he wanted.

Yesterday, immediately after I went shopping, his dad texts him to tell him that MIL decided that now she doesn't want to eat until 4 or 5 pm, which was EXACTLY when we were scheduled to have our dinner, and that is when he needs to be there. BF was LIVID. I was LIVID. It was obvious they were doing this on purpose to sabotage our plans.

My BF stood his ground, told Dictator Dad that we are not children and that they cannot make all of our plans for us without consulting us first. He stated that he will be coming over early as originally planned and they need to respect his decision on this matter and not change things last minute out of spite.

I AM SO PROUD!!!!!! He has really come a long way in communicating his needs in just one week. Normally he would just deal with it. So, this is huge. We were pretty mentally exhausted after all that yesterday, but we did go to our favorite local bar for a couple of drinks and to talk about the situation and how we are going to handle it for future holidays. We are going to have a bit of an intervention, and sit down with Dictator Dad and JNMIL and let them know that they need to stop treating us like children and need to communicate better, or we will immediately remove ourselves from any future situation. I am currently in NC with both of them until the holidays are over and we have our talk.

I am looking forward to having a really fun night with my BF, and I'm anxiously waiting to hear about what happens at Dictator Dad's holiday meal because I'm sure it will be \*interesting\*. I am sad for my BF that he doesn't get to share everything with all of us together and has parents that treat him like this, but my sanity is a priority and he was very understanding.

&#x200B;

Thanks again for all the love and support. It truly means a lot. I'm sure I will have plenty more future Dictator Dad stories to share. Happy Thanksgiving!!!",2021-11-25 09:58:41,193

324,qw4l3o,design-responsibly,"The BoM shows every sign of being composed as it was being dictated, rather than a word-for-word translation of text carefully engraved on metal plates","I was recently reading D&C 10, as it relates to a comment in another post. I noticed that verse 37 includes an immediate correction at the beginning of the verse:

>But as you cannot always judge the righteous, **or as you cannot always tell the wicked from the righteous**, therefore I say unto you, hold your peace until I shall see fit to make all things known unto the world concerning the matter.

This section is written in the first-person voice of Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith was, of course, using a scribe as he orally dictated the words as they were given to him “via revelation.” Since he was not reading them from an existing text, it’s expected that there would be lots of corrections made mid-sentence by the scribe, as with other orally-dictated documents. And if you look through the D&C for these types of things, you do find dozens of similar corrections made on-the-fly.

However, what’s really interesting about these unplanned corrections is they also appear in the Book of Mormon, and there are **a lot of them**. Richard Packham (an invaluable resource) has listed some of them here: [http://packham.n4m.org/inotherwords.htm](http://packham.n4m.org/inotherwords.htm), noting that he found only one similar example in the Bible (in an epistle of Paul). So, the BoM includes phrases such as:

*“and were permitted, or rather commanded, that they should…”*

*“And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank”*

*“as I said concerning the holy order, or this high priesthood, there were many…”*

*“and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them…”*

*“Now if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him…”*

And on and on.

All these impromptu edits are a problem for the Book of Mormon, which is said to have been laboriously engraved onto metal plates:

>Jacob 4:1. Now behold, it came to pass that I, Jacob, having ministered much unto my people in word, (**and I cannot write but a little of my words, because of the difficulty of engraving our words upon plates**) and we know that the things which we write upon plates must remain.

The writers of the Book of Mormon also worried about the plates' space limitations:

>Mormon 9:33. And **if our plates had been sufficiently large** we should have written in Hebrew

So, the Book of Mormon is said to have originally been written on plates that were very difficult to engrave on and where space was at a premium. Yet, there are numerous BoM passages containing on-the-spot corrections.

Per Packham:

>These passages indicate a marked similarity between material that Joseph Smith was dictating as it came into his mind (the D&C passages - whether one considers them as divinely inspired or simply invented on the spot) and the text of the BoM, which is an alleged translation of writings painstakingly etched onto metal plates. It is hard to imagine anyone writing on metal who would use his precious space and time to write something which immediately had to be corrected or explained or modified, that is, without planning at least a few phrases ahead. Of course anyone doing such careful writing can make mistakes. But then the mistake is scratched out. A real translator simply skips the scratched-out word or phrase. Clearly, then, Smith intends us to believe that the ancient writer on metal did not scratch out his mistakes.

As Packham puts it, “the BoM shows every sign of being composed as it was being dictated, rather than a word-for-word translation of text carefully engraved on metal plates”:",2021-11-17 11:41:05,111

333,pzoraf,hehehe233,"Roommate (27F) thought I (25F) was a lesbian, finds out I’m bisexual, now wants to dictate what I can’t wear around her boyfriend. Help.","So I (25F) live with a woman (27F) who I’m gonna call “Mary”. We met each other off a Facebook roommate finding group and have lived together for two years. We live well together but we are very different and not friends. We plan to find our own places this coming May.

Mary has a boyfriend (30s?M), “Sam”. Sam is a fine guy. He’s really quiet and we sometimes chat about Marvel. He’s at our apartment a lot, like maybe five nights out of the week. They don’t bother me.

Mary and Sam are having relationship issues. Mary is VERY emotional and Sam is emotionally closed off. More than once I’ve overheard Mary crying and Sam just shutting down. 

A few months ago there was an “incident”, let’s say, where Sam left her. She was despondent for a week…then they talked, and they were together all smiles at my place! Mary said Sam hadn’t meant to leave her, that it was a misunderstanding. This doesn’t having anything to do with the story I just think it gives them some context.

So back to me. I’m bisexual. Mary has only known me with one partner, a woman. We broke up last year and I only recently started dating again. Sometime last month, I went on a date with a guy who I really liked, so when I came home I couldn’t help but gush about him to my roommate. She was surprised I was seeing a guy. I guess she just assumed I was a lesbian (I am a bit of a tomboy lol). I came out as bi. She’s also bi, so it was a pleasant conversation.

Now, this being my house and all, I do sometimes do things like walk from my bathroom wrapped in a towel, or wear pajama shorts, or work out in a sports bra. Well today, Sam’s not here and Mary sits me down. She wants me to stop walking around in a towel or bra or “sexy PJs” when Sam is here. She told me it was making them uncomfortable and I needed to respect this boundary.

I said I would have to think about this. 

I feel like it’s obvious this only became an issue once she found out the true nature of my sexuality, like I was “safe” to be around her boyfriend when she thought I was a lesbian. I’m not attracted to him nor is anything I’m wearing overtly sexual, and this is my home! I don’t want to change how I’m living because she’s insecure about the feelings of a man who doesn’t even live here.

Soooo. What do I say? What do I do?

Things i have taught people over the years.

1. Assaulting ( Strikes , Spitting , Throwing objects / water / drinks / bottles ) meOr any other person near me results in you on the floor.
2. Your gender , skin color , sexual preference and political view points do not protect youfrom consequences to your actions.
3. 9/10 People , Male & Female get really upset when you do to a woman what she just did to a man.

Example recounting for you good people.

Location: Geraldton , Western Australia Vibe Night Club.Year : 2014.

Situation:  Aboriginal (Black) Woman refused re-entry into venue by team member due to level ofIntoxication. POI ( Person of interest ) became argumentative , threatening and loud.

After walking away from the re-entry line , turned around and punched one of my guards in the head.Striking the temple above his left eye.

Such a strike knocks your ass to the ground. Big girl. Big hit. End of story you hit the ground.Hes not a small guy. But a temple shot is a temple shot. In the real world that shit ends fights.

My response: Run at POI , side step , wrist lock her right hand ( She threw a strike ), palm her elbow to redirect her arm , wrench her right arm behind her back - hand up to the bottom of her neck ,Kick out her right ankle , left hand on her left shoulder ( Standing behind her ) , lower the cunt to the ground ( maintaining control so she does not smash her head on the driveway of the venue ).

Position her so she is laying on her left side , left arm outstretched in front of her to rest her head.Right arm wrenched behind her back to facilitate control via my right hand.My left hand free to facilitate movement if required ( Some idiots smack their heads on the ground to convince police / courts that you did more than you did - so i always kept a free hand when safe to do so free to control their heads if needed ).

Now what we have here .. is a DRUNK , BLACK , WOMAN who has been refused re-entry into a venue after smoking outside - because she clearly displayed Intoxicated behavior that would be grounds for a court fine to both the guards , bar staff and venue , and would be a failure of our duty of care if we allowed her back inside.

She was refused entry. Offered a taxi , offered water , refused all diplomacy , attacked and injured a guard. Attempted to injury the security manager. Was placed in compliance hold. Lowered to the ground. Avoiding further injury. Avoiding positional asphyxia ( no pressure on lungs or back ).

And people ... who \*EDITED FOR SPELLING \* SAW the entire series of events .... wanted to ATTACK ME ... because I ,A WHITE SKINNED , MALE  ,  with a SHAVED HEAD , had a BLACK ... WOMAN ...on the ground.

Verbal abuse such as

"" YOU HAVE A CHICK ON THE GROUND YOU RACIST CUNT """" Its just a fucking woman you gutless faggot """" BET YOUR MOTHER IS PROUD , YOU PISS WEAK CUNT ""Was constant.

Had 3 try hard white knights ( 2 Guys 1 female  , all white ) try to approach me , threatening to hurt meIf i didn't let her go.

Informed them that if they got closer than they were - I would feel threatened.IF .. i feel threatened i will BREAK  POI's  right ARM to remove her as a combatant.THEN i will deal with them.

One (1) Idiot male still tried to get close so i increased pressure on POI's arm till she screamed.This convinced idiot male to step back or risk me breaking POI's arm.

\*\* This continued with me holding her for 40 fucking minutes .. with the police station a 10 min slow walk down the road before police arrived \*\*

POI   then BIT one police officer during the hand over , kicked the other , resulting in myself and another of my staff restraining her and throwing the cunt into the back of the police car.

\*\* When i say throw .. i don't mean pushed .. i mean fucking thrown Head first into the back of the Van\*\*

POI  was released that night on BAIL ... came back to the club ... while her PARENTS were at the front door , accusing me of "" BASHING A WOMAN "" ,  "" RACIST SEXIST BEHAVIOR ""  etc.

As i explained that their DAUGHTER  had UNLAWFULLY ASSAULTED a PUBLIC OFFICER\*2 occasions ,Refused to leave a licensed premise, Committed GBH ( Grievous Bodily Harm - SHe bit remember ) 1\* Police officer and common assault \*1 Police officer ......

The fucking POI  Piece of shit ran up the drive way , throw an EMPTY BOTTLE at staff ,And as i moved to block a female staff member being hit , the bottle hit the back of my scalp , broke and bounced upwards shattering.

Even then ... bleeding from the fucking head , I noticed an African Staff member run at her ,And for those unfamiliar with that part of the world , an African security guard who grew up around Blood Diamonds , is not going to ""RESTRAIN"" a woman who just assaulted his Manager... hes going to Belt the living shit out of her  , cameras and witness's be damned.

So , again bleeding from the head , i tackle my own guard to stop him doing what i know hes going to do.

POI runs off premise , POI's parents run to their car.  And they all leave.

Bottle of water , Disinfectant , tea towel , Masking tape and box cutter later ,Wound is cleaned , tape wrapped around my head like a 1980's karate kid , and Im Explaining to crowd they need to show their ID and to comply with security requests.

POI :  Got a community service order.  Shes a woman so its less than what would happen to man , that would be a jail sentence. And shes Black , so its less than what anyone else would get because "" Racism "".

So while the ENTIRE story does not meet the PUSSY PASS DENIED ...I like to think Smashing that bitch to the ground , while doing it in a way that didnt cause her a head injury , almost breaking her arm , and causing the cunt enough pain to yell out to stop hero's from Attacking me ... has to come close.",2021-11-12 03:30:34,425

358,r35ix8,vampdreams,AITA for not letting my MIL & SIL dictate our wedding?,"Hi guys, I’m at my wits end, my wedding is in four months & would really appreciate some feedback. My fiancé (34) & I (31) met at graduate school & have been together for almost 5 yrs now. He does not have a good relationship with his family & has only kept minimal contact since he finished high school at 18.

We both wanted to get married at court, but MIL insisted on a full-fledged wedding. In her defence, she offered to pay for a chunk of it, but my we are financially comfortable & so paying ourselves. But now she wants a purely Christian wedding & refuses to include any customs that are Hindu. My fiancé agrees that we should include both our traditions, so now we’re doing the Hindu part the night before ‘the actual wedding’.

Ever since we got engaged, she has been complaining about how I’m making my fiancé look cheap & tacky because I did not want a normal wedding ring, meaning with a diamond. After he proposed with a placeholder, my fiancé & I went ring shopping & chose our engagement & wedding rings together. But she literally keeps sending me links to more ‘appropriate’ (more expensive) rings because it would save the family the embarrassment on the wedding day.

My first cousin is my MOH & an undergrad friend is a bridesmaid. SIL (bridesmaid) wants to be the MOH & threatened to not attend if we didn’t agree. My fiancé & his aunt had to talk down my M/SIL.

I want the bridesmaids in any dress style of their choice in my chosen color, & copper footwear, again in any style they feel comfortable in. SIL complained that she hated the colors & insisted we change them. We are letting her choose the dress & shoe style & buying them for her (& the whole wedding party), it shouldn’t be that big a deal, it is our day, we want it a certain way.

M/SIL have been trying to get me to push my friend out of the party, claiming her tattoos would be distracting in the photos. My fiancé & I both have tattoos, ones that would be visible, should we not attend our wedding too?

Since I refused to boot my friend out, SIL is insisting her childhood friend be in the bridal party too, since it is not fair that I get to decide who should be in OUR wedding.

MIL also wants to turn it into a black-tie affair & sent out a blast to our invitees with the ‘updated dress-code & gifts worth 250 at least (since it will help recover what the ‘family’ is spending on the wedding)’. My fiancé & I found out when one of his friends called him up to confirm. We have had to call them all up to re-confirm that they can wear anything & turn up without a gift & they would still be welcome. She also went behind our back to our wedding cake vendor, to order a more traditional cake than the cupcake tower we’d ordered.

Are we being unreasonable, should we just accept what they want & move on? It’s really putting my fiancé in a tough spot. Seriously, AITA?",2021-11-26 22:41:48,54

369,qu4qpi,Professor1970,A PERFECT DAY TRADE - simple way to let a runner run and let the market dictate where you sell.,"When I am day trading stock I look for  4 RULES to take a trade:

RULE 1: Wait for a candle that opens above the 8 ema and closes above the 8 ema (I call this the **GRA candle -  Getting Ready for Action Candle** ).

RULE 2: The GRA candle ***must be trading above the cloud (and VWAP)*** \- even better if the GRA candle is breaking thru the cloud. Bonus - Increasing volume

RULE 3: Set a buy order on on the next candle just above the high of the GRA candle (I call this **TTA candle -Time to Take Action Candle).**

RULE 4: Is the **Stock Relative Strong to the SPY?** **What is the direction of the overall market?** 

I was alerted to RIOT around 10:45 Am on a simple 5M Volume scan. I noticed that the stock broke thru VWAP on Relative strong volume - RIOT was also showing Relative strength vs the SPY at the time (not shown on  chart below).   I added the stock to the watch list and waited for Rule # 1 to apply.  You can see that around 11:15 we had a candle open up and close above the 8 ema, but it did not meet the criteria for Rule #2 (above the cloud); dang, so close, but we wait.  We keep watching another 30 minutes, and boom, we get a candle that opens and closes above the 8 EMA (see note 1);  And it meets   Rule #2 (above Vwap and the cloud - and I get the bonus (see note 3), increasing volume!!!  I put in a order at just above the high of the GRA candle (39.20) as fast as possible, which, at this time,  is also the high since the opening bar (Another bonus). I buy 1000 shares at $39.20 (i should have bought more - easy to say in hindsight).  At this time,  I am watching to make sure that this is not a bear flag (using the opening candle); I really want to see a high of day price as soon as possible, which I get 2 bars later ($40) CHA CHING! .  at this point, I am up $800, time to take profit!!! Hell no, I am a greedy SOB.

Yep, I also have RULES to sell a trade:

RULE 5:  After an entry, look for a candle that opens and closes below the 8 ema (**YMNB candle - I call this the You May need to Bail Candle)**.  This does not happen until Note 2 at $41.08;

RULE 6: After a YMNB candle look for the **GTFO candle** (self explanatory). I put a **MENTAL STOP** just below the low of the YMNB candle.

Thus my mental stop is at 41.00 (note 2). I prepare my self to exit and take my profit;  but guess what? The trade gods love me,  and the price never hit. Lucky me,  and I am still in the game!!! So, I keep waiting for Rule #5, but it never comes! The stock takes off to $44.20 and I rake in $5,000 in profits at the end of the day.  This was the PERFECT DAY TRADE!!

This works really well when you spot a stock that is trending and this is a simple way to let a runner run, and let the market dictate where you take profit.  keep in mind that the SPY was in my favor, so that helps.  In a choppy market you will experience more chop (duh!), take more losses. but the same rules can still apply. As Pete has ingrained in my brain, market first, market first, market first.

Join me on TWITTER at t\_professor1970 and follow me as I attempt to turn $5K into $30K (hopefully before year end) . I use yet another strategy where I follow the big boys where you can leverage short term call or put buying to grow an account.

The far right parties are good at rabble-rousing, but not so good at actually governing once they get elected. But globalist stooges like Frau Merkel, Macron, and Boris Johnson are going to have a harder time implementing their globalist puppet-masters' directives if Europe sees a surge in support for nationalist or populist political parties, rather than the corrupt status quo that serves only its globalist oligarch donors and pimps.

#                                               The Constitution

   
 

[The start of a long set of negotiations](https://preview.redd.it/psvm6zz6ihk61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e9cdc3a4809f0b8987123c56bc9d950e9f463b)

This is probably one of the most important parts of the game. A good constitution can make your life a lot easier and prevent your impeachment (either through the old guard taking you down for a failed attempt at constitutional reform or if your corruption is discovered later on), whilst also giving you a lot more freedom on decrees and passing legislation. When given the option to tailor your draft, here's what I recommend going with: 

* Section 1. Presidential Vetoes: **Limit with Pocket Vetoes**
   * With Koronis media on your side, this amendment gives you enough public pressure to present the constitution as progressive, although you keep an absolute veto should you want to use it. 
* Section 2. Constitutional Amendment process: **Remove supreme courts vote** 
   * Self-explanatory (plus your only option) 
* Section 3. Impeachment process: **Do not change** 
   * This tanks your support in the assembly and USP as its seen as removing any checks om your power. Later sections will ensure you're not impeached in practice, so leave this section alone. 
* Section 4. Appointment of Ministers: **Confidence Vote** 
   * Probably the most contradictory part of the constitution to your playstyle, but it increases all factions willingness to back the constitution and, in practice, the USP will always have a majority in the assembly 
* Section 5. Electoral Threshold: **Increase Threshold to 15%**
   * Attracts the support of veteran USP Members of the Assembly (MAs) whilst also making it harder for other parties to get in. Necessary for an achievement, plus kicks out the NFP at the next election 
* Section 6. Presidential Decrees: **Priority Over Statute Law + No Judicial Reviews** 
   * Basically the most dictatorial element of the constitution. Gives you free reign on your       decrees and allows you to pass other bills without having to go through the assembly 
* Section 7. Term Limits: **Do not change**
   * Not needed for passing the constitution, so why not allow yourself unlimited terms?
* Section 8. Immunity of Justices: **President Can Replace Judges** 
   * This is literally required to pass the constitution, so choosing this is a must. Also allows you to       avoid impeachment later on through a court reshuffle 
* Section 9. Honorary Membership of Tarquin Soll: **Every President Is An Honorary Member**
   * This isn't necessary and has no effect unless you retire, but what dictatorship isn't complete without a fancy title, absolute legal immunity and an expensive house? 

This constitutional Layout is the closest you can get to a functionally dictatorial political system that doesn't alienate your party and the NFP. You get all powerful decrees, security if/when you retire and legislative control whilst ensuring all concessions only apply to an assembly/Supreme Court under your control. Now its time to gather some signatures: 

#                              Negotiations: The USP Conservatives 

To get the vote to the assembly, you first need the signatures of 150 MAs, most of which will come from the USP and its various wings. 

The first wing are the conservatives, lead by Gloria Tory. As the name suggests, they want as close to the current constitution as possible, with a balance of powers favouring the old guard and a constitution that favours the USP. 

* When you start negotiating with her, make sure to emphasise how the reforms are in the name of democracy and the USP and how you'd never betray the party. 
* When it comes to amendments to the first draft, **don't budge an inch**. Refuse to give concessions      on decrees or judicial impeachments and deny her attempt to rebuke the section on the presidential Members of Honour 
* If you didn't promise to align with the east at the beginning, refused to privatise education and sided with Soll in the prologue, you should push her tolerance of reforms to the very edge without going over the cliff. **She will promise to back your reforms only if you consider her for the Supreme Court and remove your wive from speaking at Benfi, both of which you should agree too.** If you do any of the above, however, you'll have to abandon the Members of Honour Requirement to get their support, which is needed to pass the constitution. 

You Should now have the backing of the conservatives when It comes to the vote

#                              Negotiations: The USP Reformists 

Whilst theoretically this wing of the party should strike you down immediately (due to their sympathies to ""Democracy"" and ""Separation of powers"" and ""believing that the president shouldn't do whatever he wishes""), the corruption of their leader allows you to win them over 

* After the opening small talk, explain that you respect the reformists perspective on Labour reforms and decrees, although refuse to budge on the decrees. 
* When he states that even his support might not be enough, argue there must be another way, then **Promise him the VP spot in the next cabinet.** Going with a current cabinet position will harm you as he tries to take credit for the reforms down the line, but the VP promise can be abandoned at a later date. 

With their leader bought off, the Reformists will back you for signatures and votes at the assembly 

#                                        Negotiations: The NFP

The NFP is the final piece in the puzzle when it comes to securing the constitution, as its success lives or dies on their endorsement. 

* When dealing with the 15% election threshold, offer him an alliance. By the end of the game the NFP      should drop out of the assembly anyway, so this is just a formality 
* After some berating of you for being too pro bludish, he will require either that the Red Youth be banned or the Language Education Bill is vetoed. Go with banning the Red Youth (since its something you would have normally done anyway) and Kesaro will back your suggested constitution. 

With The NFPs backing, all thats left is the Assembly and the Supreme Court before the constitutional draft becomes official 

#                                                 The Assembly 

Now that we've got all the signatures and the support of every faction minus the PFJP, its time to pass the first step and get a two thirds approval in the Assembly. 

* As stated in the Personal Finance section, it's advised that you spend as much money as possible on lobbying for safety (As I haven't tried this route out with less spending than this)
* After the first reading of the new constitution, voting will begin. Head down to the Assembly Floor and you'll meet both the leader of the NFP and independents. The NFP      leader will confirm he's voting for the bill, whilst the leader of the independents should inform you that despite flaws with the bill (as it still protects Solls legal immunity), the independents will be voting for the bill. 
   * **If the leader of the independents greets you but doesn't enter a conversation, you've lost the supports of the independents by being too anti-blud, which can result in losing the vote depending on the playthrough.** 
* After you reach the floor, you'll be made aware that Soll is present in the assembly and is trying to convince MAs to vote against the constitution. To minimise his effect, get Gloria to speed up the counting (**which she will only do if she backed your constitution initially),** which reduces his effects. 
* After this and some talks with the reformists, you should be updated that the vote passed 179-72,      getting over the two thirds majority required for the constitution to pass. 

During the conservation following the passing of the constitution, Kesaro will approach ""The most dangerous men in the Maroon Palace and query about the supreme court. **Make sure to emphasise how bad the court situation looks.** Because we organised an alliance with the NFP, he will offer to organise a meeting with the deputy old guard justice. **Accept this offer, as its required for passing the constitution through:**

&#x200B;

#                                          The Supreme Court

This is the last and, at first glance, the hardest part of passing the constitution. As opposed to advocating for empowering the Assembly, a constitution that empowers the executive will leave you with no initial allies on the court as the reformists are dead set against these changes. As such, you have to get a combination of 6 Old Guard and Centrists on the court to back these reforms for it to pass. 

Winning over the centrists with an executive empowering constitution is probably the hardest negotiation in the game, as Isabel, the leader of the Centrist justices, is diametrically opposed to everything your constitution represents. She wants a balance of powers without corruption or despotism, whilst you literally want a constitution that transfers legislative powers from the judiciary (judges) to the executive (the president) and a section which grants you legal immunity and a free house for life. As such, everything has to be set up perfectly for her to back your constitution. 

My first set of advice is this. Get up from your computer, go out to your local supermarket and buy some healthy ingredients, like some lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, seedless cucumbers, red wine vinegar, feta cheese and fresh oregano. Head back home to the kitchen, cut the ingredients up, toss them together with an olive oil dressing and eat it during the negotiations. **To successfully negotiate with a salad appreciator, you must become a salad appreciator** 

   
 

[It's disappointing you have to eat herbs that arent from Sordland, but its a sacrifice you'll have to make](https://preview.redd.it/d3fbk62uehk61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fda0a1663afc8e18a4827b9b2321431ed77b6c88)

Seriously though, here's what you need to do: 

* After some small talk with a seriously miffed Justice Secretary, hold off on ordering food until Isabel arrives. Greet her and when asked by the waiter what you want, order the salad, which she will also order. This somehow increases her receptiveness to you 
* Ask how the court is and what she thinks of the proposal, emphasising the balance of powers this      constitution will bring (it wont, but the game doesn't seem to know that) 
* Emphasise how this constitution will bring about a better democracy, how respectable justices      are against the Old Guard, how you'll transparently carry out your new functions and the need to be in this together 
* Explain your opposition to the current constitution because of the judiciaries power over legislative      processes (amending the constitution) and what future reforms can be brought about if this succeeds
* When she queries about your model Supreme Court, explain its role as a defender of the constitution, striking down unconstitutional laws and engaging in judicial review, a necessary practise to ensure each branch of government recognises its own limits. 
* Despite the constitution explicitly giving the executive powers to create legislation that is immune to judicial review, she will believe you only if you studied law in the prologue. **Lacking this education background will sink any chance of getting the centrists support.**
* Explain when she queries about the costs and danger of extending the MoH title to all presidents,      explain that Soll was rather quiet after he retired, so all presidents deserve the title. 

If you follow these instructions, the salad lover herself will give in and agree to back your constitutional reform. After the successful meeting, Kesaro should contact you to let you know he successfully organised a meeting with the Deputy Chief Justice. This meeting can be organised without allying with the NFP, but either requires bribing the deputy Chief Justice (which you cant afford) or getting lucian to do it (which has a 50% chance of failing). All you need to do hear is ask for his help, which he will agree to in return for being appointed Chief Justice after Hawker is removed (this is only possible if you allow the assembly or president to impeach justices), which you should agree too. 

Following this, you should have a tense wait for the results to be announced, declaring that the constitution passed the supreme court 6 votes to 5. Congrats, you now have unchecked powers, a luxury house and security team down the line and the most unfair electoral system in Merkopa ready for the next election. 

**The War**

""War, war never changes"" 

\- Valken Kruger before Sordland got militarily decimated because Anton trusted his advice that war never changes. 

So, War. The act which turns boys into men and men into corpses. For some playthroughs (fully socialist democratic run) its necessary to stop the army from turning its weapons on the enemy and start turning their weapons on you. For others, it's a large boost in opinion that can turn a mediocre run with low popularity into a successful electoral domination. For a dictator/autocrat run, its good for opinion, but also helps add to the roleplay by carving out a bit of Rumberg for you and your allies for your/their troubles. 

To succeed in the war, I've found that there are four main areas of preparation that need to be met to prevent Rumberg knocking down the doors to the Maroon Palace. Under the four categories Ill cover what they generally mean, what requirements you have to fulfil in order to achieve that area of prep and how this is achieved in this guide.

#                              An Effective Military (Equipment) 

Due to the immense size difference in terms of army between you and Rumberg, you need to make sure that when Naval, Land and Air parity is taken into account, one Soldish soldier is equipped enough to kill more than 1 Rumbergian soldier when the fighting starts. This requires a military that plays to its strengths and dominates the areas of warfare it needs to. To beat Rumberg, you need to make sure that the following is true: 

&#x200B;

* The military as a whole is somewhat Modernised: 
   * This is achieved by either spending more money on the military and choosing to invest in modernisation rather than expanding the size of the military (what we do in this run) or joining either the ATO or CSP. Note this route requires you to leave your allies out of the fighting (as calling them in will result in a worldwide nuclear war). 
* Achieving air superiority against the Rumbergian air force to prevent troop bombardments and enable strategic bombing. 
   * This is achieved either by specifically designating that the Air Force be fully modernised (what we do in this run) following the modernisation decision above, allying with Lespia before the war breaks out (as they have a superior air force from the get-go) or joining the ATO (as stated above, this means you must fight alone) 
* Avoiding conflicts at Sea or having a well equipped Navy. 
   * The first Requirement (what this guide does) is only required if you're allied with Agnolia, as they're on the Edge of fighting with Valgsland over the central island on the map. This requires you to end the war asap with a quick strategy and adequate infrastructure to enable quick movements (covered later). Basically, avoid starting a war of attrition and avoid pissing them off that much at the UN. You'll know this is successful if you get alerted that they call for peace after the war has started. 
   * Same as modernising air force, so either fund that wing of the military during modernisation,       ally with Valgsland (who have a superior navy) or join the CSP. 

This, combined with keeping the gendarmerie in the army, should put your army in a good enough position to heavily damage Rumberg when they invade 

#                                      An Effective Military (Size) 

&#x200B;

Even if you outgun the Rumbergian army man for man, they still have three/five times the men when the war breaks out. As such, you need to even out the numbers when the fighting starts. This necessitates two requirements before the war starts: 

* Reliable allies on your side: 
   * Although logically having Lespia on your side is enough on its own to put you on parity with       Rumberg, you need at least two allies on your side who are willing to join the war to win. You only be able to have three sets of alliances that can win you the war:
      * Eyes to the left (Welhen + Valgsland socialist bloc) 
      * Eyes to the right (Agnolia + Lespia capitalist bloc) 
      * Eyes to the centre (Angolia + Welhen neutral bloc)
   * For every counter besides Welhen, you get an alliance by signing a trade deal with the respective nation. For some nations, however, certain actions will lock you out of an alliance. Valgsland won't ally with a nation that has already recognised Agnolias claims, privatised any companies, banned the Red Youth or allowed an ATO base on their territory. Lespia won't ally with a nation that cooperates with Welhen in any way, nationalises any companies or allows a CSP base on their territory. As long as you avoid this, a trade deal should guarantee an alliance 
   * For Welhen, due to their president's eccentricities, they arent the biggest fans of official treaties. Welhen will join you in the fight against Rumberg even if the news only announces a trade deal between Sordland and Welhen, but for him to offer his full support, **you must participate in Operation Bear Trap. Resisting at first and agreeing to keep your boarders shut will result in him sitting the war out, meaning you must fully help him with killing the bluds before he will fully help you in the war.**
* Infrastructure to ensure those troops arrive on time
   * Ultimately an army is useless if it can't be where the war is on time. Depending on who you ally, their armies will either start off far enough away that normal transport will take way too long to arrive to join in the fighting or have to cross through hostile territory to get there. For the following allies, you need to take these precautions to ensure their armies are effective: 
      * Agnolia: **Build the Highway.** Most of the Agnolian troops will move down south to help out i the first phase of the war, but unless you invest in the highway they will become delayed due to bad infrastructure. For this guide, invest in the highway over the Railway 
      * Lespia: **Build the Railway.** In contrast, Lespias army is on the other side of the continent, meaning they would be delayed if they took the normal route. To ensure they get there on time, make sure you construct the Railway to allow faster transportation for the Lespian army. If you've allied with the capitalist bloc, prioritise the railway over the highway (as the Lespian army is much better than the Agnolian one) 
      * Welhen: **Either Declare Bergia a Special Zone or Don't Piss of the Bluds.** Whilst the        Welhelian army is close enough to join in the fighting immediately, they have to pass through Bergia to get to the front lines, which is populated by a people who were slaughtered on mass by the very army marching through their lands. If you fail to adequately appease the Bluds during game, they'll harass the Welhelian army as it moves through the province, eventually resulting in Smolak getting fed up and calling his army back. This resistance can be prevented either by declaring Bergia a Special Administrative Region through decree (which gives the governor enough power to repress the Bluds into submission) or by appeasing them enough that they peacefully protest instead. Either way,        it ensures the Welhelian army can reach the front lines in time to contribute to the war

**If you wish to fight on your own**, then you instead need to ensure that your army is at a big enough size to contend with Rumberg. This requires you to: 

* Fund the army and use the extra resources to expand its size 
* Refuse to remove conscription to keep the extra reserves 
* enter the CSP or ATO for the army and navy/Airforce modernisation it provides. 

#                              An Effective Supply Line/Economy

&#x200B;

No matter how good your army is and (surprisingly) how short the war is, you need to ensure you have an economy prepared enough to ensure your army has all the small arms, support equipment, food and raw materials necessary to fight the war to its end. There are two factors that affect how prepared your economy is for war: 

* Integration into the global economy/International Supply lines 
   * Depending on which allies you side with, you'll have different levels of integration with the international economy. 
      * If you side with the neutral bloc, your economy will be exposed to trade for some extent but isn't integrated enough to adequately access foreign production for the war effort. If you take this route (like this guide advises), **you'll have to have a good enough domestic economy to compensate.** 
      * If you side with either the capitalist or socialist bloc, you'll be able to rely on trade with your respective group of nations to effectively supplement your domestic production. If trading by sea, however, you'll have to deal with Rumbergian subs to prevent all your tonnage from being sunk
      * Also think your infrastructure investments change how effective your capitalist/socialist trade lines are (Airport for capital, Port for socialist)), but haven't tried it out
* Domestic levels of production:
   * If you either hope to go into war alone or with the Neutral block, it's critical that you have enough domestic production to sustain the Sordland war machine. This requires you to achieve the following:
      * Have the ""increased production"" modifier when the war breaks out, which necessitates a        heavy focus on boosting production. For this, you need to **invest in either of the productivity megaprojects and the industry expansion decision,** which results in Iosef commenting that the domestic industry is prepared enough for the war. 
      * You can also avoid this requirement by choosing to invest in the Military industry specifically        (which is useful for lone fights with Rumberg), but isn't advised since it doesn't give any side benefits and costs 1 more than other industry investments. This guide calls for investing in agriculture specifically 

#                                       An Effective Set of Tactics 

Even if you an effective and well prepared military, infrastructure and economy, tactics that don't play to your strengths negate these benefits immediately. Depending on how you structure your army, your allies and your economy, different tactics are recommended: 

* Human wave doctrine: **Avoid at all costs**
   * Basically detrimental as a doctrine, as it makes no strategic sense and doesn't play to any possible playstyle. Don't use it at all unless you're curious. 
* Bunker down strategy: **Quantity over Quality**
   * This strategy works best if you're focusing on recruiting a mass army with air parity and a strong economy, making it useful for solo wars. This is essentially the attrition strategy, waiting for Rumberg to throw its thousands of men at your lines whilst you have an adequate manpower reserve to draw from and an economy which can sustain long term warfare. Falls apart with a modernist strategy, as your army isn't large enough to hold the line. 
* Iosefs Pincer Strategy: **Quality over Quantity** 
   * This strategy works best if you're focusing on an experienced, well-drilled and well-equipped military with an economy strong enough to tolerate a short period of war,       supplemented by allied forces able to push the front quickly. This is the strategy I recommend using with this guide, as it's confirmed to work successfully and plays best to the strengths we've created. It doesn't work with a large, clunky army, Rumberg dominating the air and fighting on your own, as you need both strength, air superiority and supplementary manpower to succeed. 

#                           The Winning Strategy: Allies called in 

This is the strategy I used in the guide to win the war against Rumberg whilst calling in allies but staying neutral in the greater cold war. Here's what you need to do: 

* Invest in the Highway over the Railway 
* Fund the Military, invest in modernisation, prioritise the Airforce and abolish conscription
* Give the CSP a base of operation in Sordland 
* Ally with Angnolia, take part in Bear Trap with Welhen 
* Veto Racist legislation and do everything you can to increase Blud opinion/ turn Blundia into a special      zone via decree 
* Invest in production via Sarna and Agriculture 
* Accept the defecting scientist 
* Secretly arrest the spy to avoid public backlash
* Keep the gendarmerie in the ministry of defence 
* Shoot down a Rumbergian plane in response to their aggression and expose Rumbergs nuclear weapons at the UN 
* Encourage economic growth such that you get the Sordish recovery before the war 
* Go for a modernist set of tactics: 
   * Go for Iosef's pincer manoeuvre, call in your allies and ask them to supplement your existing forces rather than going off on their own. 
   * For the second round, choose to rush down Rumbergs capital, order Welhen to stay back to protect your flank. Agnolia will siege Dome regardless of your orders 

By following this advice, The first stage should be an overwhelming success. After being lured into Sordish Territory, the Rumbergian army will be assaulted on both sides by experienced troops, with complete air domination destroying their supplies from behind and damaging their forces, resulting in the conquest of Estord. Both the Agnolian and Welhelian armies were present to assist in the fight, Agnolia from the east thanks to improved infrastructure and Welhen thanks to little resistance from the native Bludian population. Using the increased economic capacity of the economy, medical supplies were quickly shipped to the front lines, minimising casualties when possible. Using speed and agility, the Sordish army then pushed on to Rumbergs capital, capturing the queen and ending the war. The queen will then surrender Tzarboerg, Dome and parts of southern Rumberg to your alliance, winning the conflict.

#                          The Winning Strategy: Fighting Alone

This isn't specified in the guide and is less effective, but good for a player who wants a challenge. You'll need to fulfil all 4 categories using this strategy: 

&#x200B;

* Invest in whatever infrastructure you want 
* Fund the military, invest in expanding the army and keep conscription 
* Give either power a base, although not necessary 
* Trade either with Valgsland or Lespia, although other allies don't matter 
* Invest in the military industry and additional infrastructure (Airport if Lespia trade deal, Port      if Valgsland Trade deal) 
* Accept Defecting Scientist 
* Do what you want with the spy, as long as shes arrested/killed
* Keep the gendarmerie in the ministry of defense 
* Shoot down a Rumbergian plane in response to their aggression and expose Rumbergs nuclear weapons + Weapons Smuggling at the UN 
* Encourage economic growth such that you get the sordish recovery before the war 
* Go for a defensive set of tactics: 
   * Choose to bunker down and withstand the Rumbergian human waves 
   * For the second round, choose to rush down Dome and capture it before going for their Capital 

Because I haven't done this tactic since 1.1.2 was released, i don't know much details on the conflict. I do know that these decisions result in your plans succeeding and the Rumbergian army losing first its momentum and second its strategic infrastructure and economic heartland. After this victory, Rumberg's Queen will offer a surrender, gaining you the territories of Tzarboerg and humiliating the queen. Because of how bold a plan going in alone was, you should also make sure to send her a message from your son (which you'll know when you try this out yourself) 

 

#                                                 Conclusion: 

So, you've reached the end of the game. You've brought back the economy from ruins with improved living standards, consolidated your hold on power with a crippled opposition and created a constitution which has given you nearly unchecked power for your second term. 

This is the end screen I got: 

   
 

[Now those are the achievements of a true dictator](https://preview.redd.it/sumbxi77hhk61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=44cd0119df1106bfbf6c78119b09ea6a45a31507)

It's not the best results, as this type of route is never suppose to be fully wholesome, but is enough to get a couple of achievements and place your accomplishments in the annals of Sordish history. Reflecting on this playthrough, there are a couple of additional notes which I want to add: 

&#x200B;

* For people who don't want to treat the Bluds as well as is done here, you can win the war without      Welhens help if you invest in the military industry instead (which costs -1 budget in the long run). If you do this, I would recommend that you don't sign all the anti- Blundish legislation (specifically sign the religion bill but veto the language act) that Kesaro puts on your desk, as signing both causes a Blundish terrorist attack which seriously harms your popularity and economy. 
* For Autocratic players, this strategy can be adapted to an old guard playthrough rather easily, just      make sure to do the following: 
   * Disregard all spending and decisions related to the constitution and its section of the guide.       You'll be ruling through the old one anyway, so expenditures/corruption that would be necessary on that route aren't needed now. 
      * This also means you don't have to start off middle class or choose law as your educational background. 
   * Campaign on and tighten immigration when you're given the opportunity, as well as nationalising HOS in addition to Bergia steel (the -1 budget can be offset by privatising prisons instead of creating the fair trade commission), as not doing this after you extend the emergency decree will result in your impeachment by the supreme court, leading to what is essentially a ""game over"".",2021-03-01 15:34:53,122

The amount of money you are willing to give them should not dictate how much fun you have.","*Before I even begin, I already know there are plenty of people on this sub who use Tibia as a source of income. While I feel bad that whatever is going on in your life that requires you to make a living from a currency in a video game, your livelihood is not paramount to my enjoying any game.*

At their core, all mmo's are designed to create a space where you can make lifelong friends and share a common goal in playing a game. I started playing Tibia over 20 years ago as a kid, the community was awesome. There was a sense of family and exploration, and CIP has never done anything to ensure it stays that way. Instead CIP has fostered a community that thrives on conflict, rewarding players for dominating others to the point where they quit. I've never seen a game where players were allowed to effectively ban other players leading to empty servers.

They have consistently ignored player feedback to the point where it seems they do it out of spite, all the way back to earlier days when botters ran rampant and they did nothing about it until the player base completely bottomed out while servers emptied except for the botting dominating guilds who hunted everyone else off. When they got to the point that even the botters were leaving because they weren't making money, they finally did something about it.

Their priority has and always be getting as much money from you as possible since the introduction of premium scrolls in 2012. It has adopted a mobile game style business model that trades power or time saved for money and this effects everyone negatively when the in game currency is directly tradable to other players.

The argument ""It's a business of course they want to make as much money as possible."" just reiterates my point that you're nothing but a credit card to these people. There's a reason almost everyone you meet in this game has played back before TC, and almost no one joins this game fresh and lasts long before they encounter a dominating guild, or hit some crazy cost like 15kk for an item and don't want to either grind for months to get it, and refuses to buy TC to get it.

What that has always led to in this game is the exact same as real life, an elite 1% who do everything in their power to make as much money as possible. Things like spawns where people are not allowed to hunt, quests people are not allowed to do, I remember specifically at one point on a server I played on that no one was allowed to level a mage past level 45.

Even on the rare server that doesn't have these issues, the cost of getting these items is extreme. 250kk+ for some soul items. Hunting in these areas is already next to impossible for most people, with an extremely low drop rate for people who do.

This has only gotten worse over time, and has no indication of improving. This game has many problems, that CIP has refused to resolve without the use of your credit card.

A few examples over the past 10 years years:

* Introduction of Premium scrolls that can be traded for in game gold
* removal of target dummies in Edron that were replaced with offline training
* Introduction of ever increasing charges of training weapons
* Addition of TC, tradable to other players via the market board who's value in gold has jumped up to almost 40k per TC.
* 50 outfits added to the store, 7 of which were removed years ago because they were outdated are 20 years old that were added back for a high cost
* Char Bazaar, where high level characters are selling for literally thousands of dollars US in TC.
* Introduction of weapon upgrading systems that require you to purchase copies of the weapons from other players at an extremely high cost, with a chance that the upgrade fails and you lose most of that investment.
* Purchasing supplies directly in the store
* daily bosses with a less than 5% rare drop rate
* The introduction of new worlds, knowing that dominating guild rush them to ensure a steady income of TC.
* Combining worlds, knowing that it will cause conflict, and another steady income of TC.

Tibia has become a game with 25 year old problems that can only be fixed by swiping a credit card, even now the new ""features"" being introduced are heavily influenced by how much money you spend. CIP is absolutely shameless in the lack of pride and effort they put into this game. Read any auditorium post, and you'll see that they don't give a shit about your opinion of their updates. They don't respond to feedback, and any kind of ""This isn't fun"" is met with ""This thread has been locked due to lack of constructive feedback""

If you don't recognize that a company does not value you as a person, but instead as a source of income, you need to reevaluate your life and what this game has to offer.

I personally won't be spending any more money on this game outside of premium time, and that's only because I want to spend time with my friends, not because this game deserves it.

TL/DR: You're nothing but a dollar sign to this company, and a lot of you are delusional.",2021-11-29 16:59:06,20

The three “fundamental conditions to be able to move on to the executive phase of the project” were outlined by the same Hall with a communication on its social channels. The first, he writes, "" is that the new stadium will have to substantially respect the lines and volumes contained in the feasibility study that has already been presented to the Administration"". 


“The second point calls for a reconversion of the area of ​​the current San Siro in order to develop the project for the sport and entertainment district, in a green context (also in this case as per the dossier already presented). Regardless of the timing of construction of the new stadium, the opening ceremony of the 2026 Winter Olympics will take place in the current facility ( San Siro), as a tribute to its glorious history ”, he continued.


""Finally, third and last point, that the concessions of volumetric rights for urban development accessories to the stadium do not derogate from what is permitted by the current PGT"" , the law states.


""The two companies - he added - have agreed with these proposals"" . This is why the Mayor believes ""that the council can proceed quickly to deliberate the public interest"".

I am one of 10% of New Yorkers who have survived the Political Psy Op Campaign Known as Get Vaccinated! I am a survivor of COVID-19 and am UnVaccinated as well. Come at me. 

&gt; There is a direct correlation between people being vaccinated and the infection rate. We have created a dynamic where you can get vaccinated anywhere. It's that last 10% that's holding us back,"" the governor said, calling that frustrating.

I love how she admits we have heard immunity yet says the UnVaccinated are holding us back. 

&gt; These are exceedingly small numbers, Hochul acknowledged, but given that research has shown COVID vaccine efficacy wanes over time regardless of brand -- and that a highly vulnerable stretch of time is approaching with the holiday season -- she says she won't wait for the situation to worsen before taking stronger action.

So you admit it doesn’t work. 

&gt; The governor did indicate any potential changes would likely involve a targeted approach, perhaps one similar to that her predecessor rolled out a year ago.

Incoming lockdown for the Unvaccinated Austria Style. 

&gt; Hochul had said she had hoped to be rid of masks in schools by now, but that's not appropriate given the current climate. 

We all know that is 100% a lie with 90% Vaccination rate. Masks are here forever. 

&gt;She said COVID rate increases need to stop and vowed to back any local health department that imposes stricter measures.

She wants a Medical Dictatorship.
