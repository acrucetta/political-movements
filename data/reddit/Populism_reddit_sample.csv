Deep-blue Seattle saw the progressive candidate for mayor lose by ~30, the progressive City Council member running to take the mayoral candidate's seat lose by about 20, and the progressive candidate for City Attorney lose by about 28. In Buffalo, the progressive candidate, who had endorsements from AOC, Bernie, and Schumer LOST BY ALMOST 20 POINTS TO A WRITE-IN CAMPAIGN. In Minneapolis, the resolution to replace the police department with a Public Safety Department (overwhelmingly backed by Progressives) lost 56-44.
Progressive lost big in DEEP BLUE CITIES. If they can't win there, on progressive home turf, why would anyone bet on them winning swing areas?
Meanwhile, in VA, Youngkin dishonestly painted McAuliffe as extremely progressive on social issues, something McAuliffe's bad campaign failed to reverse. And surprise, in a high-turnout race where the voters who showed up favored Biden by 2 points, McAuliffe lost.
Meanwhile, in Congress, despite being warned that failure to pass anything would harm the VA race, the Progressive caucus in the House blocked a vote on the popular infrastructure deal in hopes of getting more concessions on the social spending deal. They may, if they are lucky, get some of what they want on that deal, but in the meantime they managed to grind Congress to a halt, which was not popular with voters.",2021-11-03 15:58:04,93

30,q8l9lw,Lovethecreeper,r/PeoplesPartyOfCanada is a subreddit for the far-right and populist People's Party of Canada who promotes anti-vaccine conspiracy theories including great reset conspiracies along with other bigotry.,"[If you're having difficulties understanding my post format](https://np.reddit.com/user/Lovethecreeper/comments/q8kvxa/my_format_for_ragainsthatesubreddits_posts/)

almost 1 month ago the most recent Canadian Federal Election happened in which the People's Party of Canada (abbreviated PPC)  participated as the 5th most powerful party in the election. This party is similar ideologically to other right-wing populist parties in Europe such as the AfD or Vox. Unless Reddit's search feature isn't working correctly, this would be the first post on r/AgainstHateSubreddits about this subreddit and party.

The most prominent and upvoted posts on the PPC's subreddit is anti-vaccine and anti-mask propaganda along with an (un)healthy dose of COVID-19 conspiracy theories mixed with some other bigotry. 

[Front Page of the PPC Subreddit](https://archive.is/69ZKC)

Let's take a look at some of the posts in the subreddit.

[Post #1: False information and conspiracy theories](https://archive.ph/3oM6J)

Post Title: Just one example of the propaganda and manipulation about covid. This time she could not deny it. (Dr.Hinshaw says new information shows the death of a 14-year-old, reported Tuesday, was not from COVID-19. This comes after the boy's family posted on social media, saying he had died of brain cancer)

Context: This is a post propagating the conspiracy theory that people dying in hospitals are being marked as COVID-19 deaths when they aren't. This is part of a larger conspiracy theory that seeks to vilify medical professionals and is related to other anti-vaccine and anti-mask conspiracy theories.

Comment Examples:

1.0, +5 
> Nothing to see here 👀

2.0, +6 
> Lies,manipulating , incompetence is what these top doctors provincially are showing. Next they will show the look of defeat. This is all one big distraction/ smokescreen for their criminal neglect of our seniors in care homes in this country have been subject to for almost 3 decades.
They let our most vulnerable and dear citizens down fellow PPC members. Let us not ever forget the incompetence from day one to protect our most loved citizens. They let our seniors down so badly in care homes and they are the absolute most primary concern for risk to this virus.
The entire countries politicians at all levels have failed. Refocusing is paramount no matter what for all on both sides of this division Politicians and health Authorities have plagued us with.
I am disgusted by Hinshaw and every other top doctor running their respective health authorities in every province. Travesty, they should all be fired.

2.1, +6 
> After getting caught lying so many times, they wonder why there is a dearth of trust in the medical establishment. This is what happens when debate is silenced and only one narrative is allowed.

[Post #2: Vaccine mandate misinformation](https://archive.ph/evOdO)

Post Title: “Immunization is not mandatory in Canada,” says @GovCanHealth 1996 ‘National Report On Immunization’. “It cannot be made mandatory because of the Canadian Constitution.” Department refuses comment. #cdnpoli #MandatoryVaccination

Context: General misinformation and conspiracies about vaccine mandates. Some in this post blast the Canadian government for not behaving as recklessly as the US government did.

Comment Examples:

1.0, +6 
> It's not ""mandatory"" as in the government can't strap you down and inject you, but that doesn't mean the government can't coerce the shit out of you by removing your ability to work, or shop, or live anything but the most wretched life. Rights in Canada aren't worth anything near as much as people like to think.

1.1, +3 
> Our charter of rights is Swiss cheese compared to the US constitution. Many rights like free speech that Canadians believe they have are uniquely American

2.0, +3 
> Its time trudy tells the truth and stops treating Canadians like [Ableist Slur].

3.0 +2 >
> Great. This sh!t is falling apart on them enforcers in a hurry 😝 Great info thanks for the post 👍

[Post #3: Implied racist and sexist remarks with supposed unvaccinated wage gap](https://archive.ph/JaqWO)

Post Title: It's Time To Talk About The Wage Gap Of The Unvaccinated.

Context: This post mixes COVID-19 conspiracy theories about vaccine mandates/passports with a thinly-veiled racist and sexist undertone.

Comment Examples:

1.0, +5 
> Yep. We were marching around all last year burning down buildings for this moment: standing strong for ""Equality"". What an equitable outcome this chart shows!!

2.0, -6 
> Ignoring the fact that the red bar should be about 1/10 the size of the blue bar on the left, were missing one key point here: the 'red bar' made a choice that reduces their employment capability. The result of that is on them.

Above comment was pointing out logical errors when making this argument/post. The response from OP is sexist and transphobic, noted below.

2.1 +5 
> Are you implying that women get paid 70 cents on the dollar because they haven’t made the choice to become men which would improve their employment capability?

Further responses to the above comment

2.1.1 0 
> AHAHAH!!! you've reached a new level of Simple Jack, congrats

2.1.2 0 
> If youre comparing getting a vaccine to gender transitioning, not only are you entirely off base, but it shows you dont understand the dynamics at all.

More standard anti-vaccine misinformation

2.2 +4 
> Thank you for not running for Premier. The world could do with less ignorant religiosity leading the charge. Choice is choice. Mandates are tyranny. Open your eyes, son.

2.2.1 -6
> Choice is choice. Consequences are consequences. Mandates are legal.

Comment above points out not taking vaccines is a choice, response below draws a false equivalence to racial slavery.

2.2.1b +3 
> They had that same mentality in the slave years, bud. Consequences of skin colour lead to legal abuse. Don't be a Democrat - everyone should have the right to pursue happiness. It's only humane.

2.2.1c -1 
> So youre comparing a vaccine to slavery now?

2.2.1d +5 
> No, I was comparing your defense of Choice vs Forced Consequence to Slavery. But yes, if you'd like to go there, Vaccine Mandates create segregation. Except this time, it doesn't matter what your skin colour is.

another comment comparing vaccine mandates to racial discrimination 

2.2.1aa +2
> So was Jim Crow and the uighur genocide

2,2,1ab -1
> Comparing a vaccine to ethnic and racial discrimination is pretty disgusting

2.2.1ac +3
> They are likely not comparing the damage of Jim Crow or Uighur Genocide to vaccine mandates, but rather pointing out that they were both “legal”, basically saying that just because it is legal doesn’t mean it is right.
The first thing most authoritarian governments do is make it “legal” to take away rights and freedoms, taking away guns, controlling the media, etc...
Don’t just simplify everything to make it easier to understand for yourself. You are either ignorant of what they were talking about or blatantly misrepresenting what they were saying so you could call them an idiot and/or disgusting.

63,qv0bhy,hwagoolio,CMV: China is a utilitarian state whereas the US is a populist state,"I think there's a popular conception that China (the CCP in particular) is ""evil"", ""tyrannical"", and that it's only objective is to maintain its own power.

Personally, I don't really think that this is actually the case. I have a lot of problems with China and I don't condone its countless human rights violations, but IMO the Chinese leadership still seeks to benefit the majority of the Chinese population as a whole.

I think China is predominantly utilitarian in its values. China is much more willing to sacrifice the rights/livelihood of individuals to benefit the perceived ""greater good"". Various fundamental Western human rights are highly individualistic, in the sense that it's not okay in Western states to violate the rights of a single individual. China, in contrast, is happy to violates the right of particular individuals to benefit the rest of society. Furthermore, (anecdotally having visited China many times), most Chinese citizens are content with their own government and happy about the immense economic growth it brought them.

The reason why I don't think the CCP is exclusively concerned with maintaining its own power (and is instead concerned with a somewhat distorted sense of ""greater good"") is due to many policies that the CCP pursued in the past.

For example, the single-child policy was intensely unpopular in China and there's no sensible reason why a selfish government only concerned with maintaining its own power would ever pursue it. It's political suicide and brings no benefits to the ruling party (politically speaking), and it doesn't enhance the CCP's power in any way. 

I believe the single-child policy was pursued in China for (perceived) utilitarian reasons -- the CCP believed that overpopulation was a major concern for China's future, and they believed that limiting overpopulation would be beneficial for the Chinese people over time even if it is incredibly unpopular in the beginning. China, in short, is willing to pursue short-term unpopular policies with the belief that it will bring long-term benefit.

Of course, scientists/engineers in the CCP might be totally wrong about their judgement (we now think that low birth rates are problematic for China's future), but I think China primarily functions through a utilitarian value system that disregards many fundamental Western human rights for every individual. Democratic states, in contrast, function primarily through populism, which makes it more difficult for things like environmental initiatives to be implemented in democratic states if it isn't popular among a majority of citizens.",2021-11-15 23:19:11,0

76,pmxzy6,labelleprovinceguy,"The National Populist Illusion: Why Culture, Not Economics Drives American Politics","So I posted this on the 538 sub and it generated a good discussion but this is a rather larger sub so I thought I'd post it here as well (a lot of you would like r/538 though) It's a report issued by the Center for Partisanship and Ideology which examines, in short, why Trump supporters are Trump supporters.  [https://cspicenter.org/reports/the-national-populist-illusion-why-culture-not-economics-drives-american-politics/](https://cspicenter.org/reports/the-national-populist-illusion-why-culture-not-economics-drives-american-politics/)

I'll copy and paste my summary of it from my original post below:

Hanania and Hawley are two very interesting writers and I think they make great use of data to explain why support for Trump is overwhelmingly rooted in his culture war populist-nationalism and not his sporadic dissents from Republican orthodoxy (for instance attacking Jeb Bush for wanting to cut Medicare and Social Security) or even his more consistent protectionist message on trade. They also posit the Obama-Trump voter phenomenon is less a product of voters being attracted to Trump's somewhat dissident economics but rather a product of the rising salience of cultural issues. In short, a voter who was in favor of immigration restriction and gun rights but for more government support for health care might have voted on the latter issue in 2008 and 2012 but was far less likely to by 2016.

This is something of a rebuttal to people like Michael Lind who argue Trump's appeal is largely economic and can be effectively countered by having Democrats become more populist on economics. Hanania and Hawley argue pretty convincingly this is pretty implausible. The question, then, is why so many Democrats believe it? I would suggest two answers (a) a lot of Democrats want to move left on economics so this is a way to argue for it. If you don't like free trade, say crucial swing voters in Wisconsin don't either and will vote on that issues and (b) the alternative would be Democrats moving not left on economics but right on culture. That might mean cracking down more on illegal immigration, giving up on gun control, focusing less on trans rights. Whatever. But most Democrats care a lot about these issues and find the prospect of going in that direction unthinkable.

82,qbr7x3,master_at_winning,I am so sick of McGowan’s populist attitude,"We will soon be the only state to not have a border reopening plan (Tas and SA will release theirs within days). Why does he act like having open borders is the end of the world, clearly the rest of the world has moved on, some without even internal restrictions like the UK. Even if some light restrictions have to be reintroduced (e.g. mask wearing), either he really failed to understand the mood of the people in wanting to reunite with families, or he is actually correct and the majority of people in this state are idiots who can’t handle to wear a mask in a shopping centre for a few hours at most and thus would be selfish enough to demand closed borders. If it’s an economic decision like not wanting West Australians from spending their tourism dollars interstate or overseas, then that is unconstitutional and I hope he loses in the High Court. Also as part of the national plan, I thought we were meant to live normally with COVID as the vaccination rate increases? So why bother reintroducing internal restrictions and reimposing lockdowns when it clearly states that jurisdictions do not have to increase their baseline restrictions. Why can’t we be like Denmark who has the best of both worlds, open borders and no domestic restrictions? If our hospital system is shit, why should we be punished as a society when it is the fault of the politicians to fix their mess? How come NSW doesn’t have the same issues?

People are literally acting like McGowan is the second coming of Christ or something. He only got lucky because we are a low density sparsely populated state, so COVID would struggle to spread unlike places like Melbourne or London. Also, most of our money comes from mining, so it’s extremely feasible to close state borders and lock us down due to one local case unlike Sydney. We have no border towns and barely any tourists come here even before COVID.

Hanania and Hawley are two very smart guys who aren't afraid to offer contrarian takes. Their basic argument is that the roots of the support for Trump and right-wing politics more broadly is overwhelmingly a product of culture and not economics. In contrast to commentators who suggest Democrats can win a large chunk of the Trump Republican vote by embracing economic populism, they marshal some pretty convincing evidence that cultural issues matter far more to these voters than economic ones and will overwhelmingly determine their vote.

But what about the Obama-Trump voters? The research does indeed show that these voters are attracted to some economic populist positions (but nothing like the full-blown socialism the Left wants). They might favor a public option in health care, taxing the rich more, restricting immigration, gun rights, and a 'law and order' approach to crime. In 2008 and 2012, they were more likely to vote on the basis of their former views and therefore to support Obama. Since 2012, however, the issues on which they hold a right-wing position have become far more salient and are likely to remain more salient and core to their identity, therefore making it very hard for the Democrats to bring them back into the fold.

 Populist Uprisings should work on the vassal level, not on the direct liege. If the revolters win they take over the counties/vassal title and pay reduced levies(and or they could be given religious rights feudal contract).  Firstly, This should make AI empires more stable, since they don't get mass declared on(and surrender to 9 revolts at once). There could also be a pop up to ask the liege to join the vassal war, not doing so results in a huge opinion malice. 

My thinking behind this kind of change is two fold; one it will of course allow AI empires to be more stable for the player to have more ""challenges"" to interact with. Secondly, it should make the player interact more with their vassals, and the fedual contract system.

146,qug73x,plumingo,"[Q] What is ""a populist vote""?","I found the term, ""populist vote"" from a news article about Elon Musk. Below is the original content.

&#x200B;

*If and when Elon Musk sells a large chunk of his Tesla shares, it'll probably have relatively little to do with a Twitter poll among his loyal followers — and everything to do with a looming multi-billion-dollar tax bill. Musk published a Twitter poll over the weekend, noting that because he doesn't receive a cash salary he pays income tax only when he sells shares. The tweet got attention, but the move is not really about* ***a populist vote***. *The real reason is because Musk is just months out from a deadline to exercise the stock options he received years ago. If he doesn't use them, he loses them. And if he does exercise his shares, he's going to face a monster tax bill between nearly $11 billion to as much as $16 billion at current share prices. If this still isn't totally clear, tap the link in our bio for more.* ⁠

151,pfen97,portlandwealth,DISCUSSION: is the left stunted when they endorse the populist label?,"Hi There so I have been thinking about this and  want to see if you guys think like this. 

I have been a secular talk fan for a couple years. And I been sort of falling of /losing interest in the whole populist movement.
I have my reasons mostly it boils down to there's a lot of populist things that are shit. Liek lack of interest in immigration, minority rights, and LGBT related rights. 

I can't really get behind that and I have noticed that channels like secular talk, or even Dore ( insert throwing up emoji) really have blind spots in these subjects like it's all economics to the and the other things are secondary or hardly matter. 
I honestly think that also them flirting with right wingers like saagar or Carlson doesn't  help the lefts plight if anything it stunts it.
And you get right wingers who like lefty populist policy like m4a and free college that  most would want that if it meant making it an ethnostate or leaving minorities and immigrants out of it. 

Anyways TLDR I think the populist movement stunts the left and channels like Dore and secular talk and breaking points are doing damage to the left or at least stunting it hard and it will make it hard to progress. 

Maybe I'm outgrowing and becoming more interested in leftist progressive views but channels like vaush, hasanabi and Sam seeder and late Michael brooks (rest in power) did more justice to the lefts cause.",2021-08-31 15:54:15,5

163,q5ixzp,lozgod,I am Lozgod and I am running for Governor of Pennsylvania as a Populist Republican,"I want to make generational change in PA. Some bullet points on my agenda are:

1. I liked the goals but not the methods of Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda in 2021 that was inevitably defeated when former senator and now Vice President Kyrsten Sinema (R) and Joe Manchin voted with Republicans and never caved to party pressure. 

My plan understands that Government is not effective nor efficient with money for initiatives that large and the State of Pennsylvania will incentivize companies to provide day care and family leave and sick day benefits with significant tax breaks for those that do. 

2. I will also incentivize companies with significant tax breaks that pay above scale wages to employees. 

For instance if the regional wage for a super market clerk is $16 an hour and you pay your clerks $20 an hour your state taxes will be .25% to .75% lower depending on your profits and payroll size. 

3. I will work with our legislative branch to secure our elections. I am very much aware of Republican poll watchers being ejected in Philadelphia in 2020 and heroin addicts being paid to register and vote Democrat. No matter how much the propaganda machine we call the media lies the truth is the truth. The only big lie was calling the truth the big lie. That will be fixed before the next mid terms. 

4. I will work with the legislative branch to remove our current redistricting committee and give control of redistricting to the legislative branch as is done in states like Texas and Georgia and Oregon so that the will of the people may be done. 

5. I will pass a budget that balances the state budget without raising taxes on PA residents. I will appoint a board to audit our spending, especially in social services, to ensure money is being used effectively and efficiently and to identify and prosecute fraud. We will also put in place harsh penalty for social service fraud. We need to provide for our working poor and elderly and disabled without the system being abused. 

6. The state will work with private drug treatment companies to fight addiction which is tearing families and communities apart. 

7. Cities and municipalities will be expected to offer effective policing and justice in our communities. Any cities or counties found to be “defunding” police or being soft on crime where prosecutors are not prosecuting criminals then those cities/counties will lose significant state funds. The state is open to effective crime strategy but decriminalizing crime is off the table. Especially in communities where people of color are victims of epidemic levels of crime and white liberal politicians are ignoring the problems as if they don’t exist. In my administration we will put law abiding citizens before criminals. 

8. We will protect human life and that includes human life waiting to get the opportunity to experience life. I plan to implement the same model Texas did which the Supreme Court agreed was constitutional in 2022.",2021-10-10 18:05:16,8

> The far-right populist Jos&eacute; Antonio Kast is on course for a convincing victory over former protest leader Gabriel Boric in the first round of Chile&#039;s presidential election.

> With more than 90% of the votes counted, Kast led Boric by 28% to 25.6%. The two will meet in a runoff next month.

> Two other presidential hopefuls, centrist Yasna Provoste and former minister Sebasti&aacute;n Sichel, underperformed notably - each drawing about 12% of the vote.

> The vote marks a sharp departure from the progressive trajectory Chile has followed since era-defining anti-inequality protests exploded in October 2019.Millions took to the streets in demonstrations to decry a host of inequalities and injustices, leading to the country opting to rewrite its dictatorship-era constitution in a plebiscite last October.

> Since voting became voluntary in 2013, the first round of a presidential election has never had a turnout of more than half of registered voters.

> The runoff between Boric and Kast will be held on 19 December, and Chileans face an anxious wait to see how the other candidates&#039; first round votes will be divided between the two leading candidates and their starkly contrasting national projects.

My brother's friend is doing doctoral work in political science and sent me over this paper because he knows I'm a huge nerd and love this stuff. I figured you all would too. [https://cspicenter.org/reports/the-national-populist-illusion-why-culture-not-economics-drives-american-politics/](https://cspicenter.org/reports/the-national-populist-illusion-why-culture-not-economics-drives-american-politics/)

Hanania and Hawley are two very interesting writers and I think they make great use of data to explain  why support for Trump is overwhelmingly rooted in his culture war populist-nationalism and not his sporadic dissents from Republican orthodoxy (for instance attacking Jeb Bush for wanting to cut Medicare and Social Security) or even his more consistent protectionist message on trade. They also posit the Obama-Trump voter phenomenon is less a product of voters being attracted to Trump's somewhat dissident economics but rather a product of the rising salience of cultural issues. In short, a voter who was in favor of immigration restriction and gun rights but for more government support for health care might have voted on the latter issue in 2008 and 2012 but was far less likely to by 2016.

This is something of a rebuttal to people like Michael Lind who argue Trump's appeal is largely economic and can be effectively countered by having Democrats become more populist on economics. Hanania and Hawley argue pretty convincingly this is pretty implausible. The question, then, is why so many Democrats believe it? I would suggest two answers (a) a lot of Democrats want to move left on economics so this is a way to argue for it. If you don't like free trade, say crucial swing voters in Wisconsin don't either and will vote on that issues and (b) the alternative would be Democrats moving not left on economics but right on culture. That might mean cracking down more on illegal immigration, giving up on gun control, focusing less on trans rights. Whatever. But most Democrats care a lot about these issues and find the prospect of going in that direction unthinkable.

They promise to represent the common people, stand up to the powers that be in Washington, bla bla bla.

I don’t think I’ve known a single politician who runs on being “the man of elites”. Not Lincoln, not Kennedy, not Reagan, not Clinton, not Bush, not Obama, not Trump, not Biden, and so on.

>My entire adult life, I have been a progressive. To me that label meant that when done well, government, is capable of improving the lives of people.  With better design, and better incentives, government (a form of collective action) can enhance freedom, and promote good choices. 

>For the 3 people who read Ending Medical Reversal (2015), Malignant (2020), and the 300 papers I’ve published, you will not be surprised to hear this is my view—it is present in all my work.

>To me Progressivism has several corollaries:

•	It means freedom of speech and freedom to think, even if those views threaten the powerful

•	It means society is judged by how it treats the poorest amongst us, not by how it rewards the rich

•	Structures—political, economic, social—are the real root of problems, and solutions require careful, incremental fixing of structures, not shaming or blaming of individuals. 

•	Tolerance & compassion were core tenets amongst progressives I admired.

>COVID19 killed progressivism.  People who identify on the political left, are increasingly frenzied and disinhibited. Their policies contradict all of the principles of progressivism. Let me highlight a few e.g..

>**1.     Censoring misinformation.** Many progressives have embraced the idea that social media must censor ‘misinformation.’  But none of them are capable of defining the line between honest debate and misinformation. Few appreciate the potential for an authoritarian to abuse this power.  [see video](https://youtu.be/IV5c8mva9-s)

>And consider the case of lab leak—Facebook suppressed discussion of it for 4 months—only to rescind after it was clear we needed to have that discussion. You cannot censor science in a crisis. It is too volatile, too live, and too unsettled.

>**2.     We forgot the poor!** The policies that were pushed by the left were policies that shielded principally the zoom class of worker—the upper middle class, highly educated laborer.  Among these: school closures.  What will soon be seen as the greatest policy blunder of the pandemic; One that will scar the lives of hundreds of thousands of kids.  This policy was pushed by left of center cities, and cities with strong teachers’ unions.  Progressives forgot about the poorest amongst us, while red states remembered.

>**3.     Blamed people not structures**—the rhetoric online was a constant stream of shame and blame. Good people (those who can afford to stay home) and bad people (all the rest).  The shaming and blaming and moralizing continue to this day.  Pre-vaccine everything was the fault of libertines who would not stay home, and post vaccine everything is the fault of the unvaccinated.

>**4.     Tolerance & compassion has been replaced** by vaccine passports, and mandates, and passionate calls that people who decline vaccination should pay higher premiums, lose their jobs or not receive medical care! 

>Progressives have forgotten that the structures of society—our tribalism, our income inequality, our politics—trap people in information bubbles where they are not given open and honest information about vaccines. On the other side, there is a different bubble of dishonesty that won’t consider adverse effects fairly. I learned this the hard way, trying to talk about the benefit of vaccination while reducing the risk of myocarditis.

>**In short, for each pillar of progressivism that once existed, we instead have the precise opposite sentiment among self-proclaimed liberals.**

>A full analysis of the origin of this swing is beyond me, but it is undeniable that many people were anchored to Donald J. Trump. Whatever he said, we did the opposite. That is evident by massive opinion poll swings in school re-openings the moment he said we ought to do them, documented by Vlad Kogan.

>That was the original sin. Closing schools for so long in Democratic stronghold cities, strong union cities, precisely after the President that many disliked pushed for [them to be open].  But no matter how wrong he was about other matters, he was right on that issue.  We should have reopened schools. And the net result has been **devastation so catastrophic it will shape this country for the next 100 years, if we survive it**.

Opinion is seen as counterproductive and offensive. If criticism is made of the architecture of a certain construction. Our colleague responds with ""you're just biased"" in a nasty tone. Or if we are to judge an exhibition as subpar, we give the impression that we highly inflate ourselves in a snobbish manner. 

Politeness demands that we appear as agreeable as possible to our fellow citizens. It is a great quality but it also has excesses. 

The monotony of conformity is only broken by those writers, those artists, those speakers, who are indeed biased. They challenge their society to reflect on issues and therefore attempt to fix them. 

Counterarguments exist for a reason too. They should be used and in doing so, the dialogue can get started. But if everybody stays humbly silent because they fear coming across as biased then is that really a mark of a free people?

And it has been seen that in many people there is this habit to use the counterargument of reductio ad absurdum. Reducing the argument to absurdity. Clearly this is a challenging position for anybody. Another very common one is argumentum ad populum. Argument to the people. 

This counterargument replies that the speaker's opinion is 'against the people'. It is an argument used everywhere and in every time. The logic being that the people have de facto the correct view of things and this usually means the majority of people in a given society.

**Thus the post-left conventional wisdom---that right-wing sentiment among native workers is driven by rising competition with cheap imported labor---has no grounding in fact.** Indeed, that notion is such utter bullshit that anti-immigrant parties must resort to middle-class arguments about crime and welfare fraud/""tax dollars"", as well as outright language/culture/religion/race idpol, in order to win enough votes to matter. Immigrants aren't stupid; while they've got [slightly](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/forbrn.t05.htm) lower standards than native workers, they tend to follow jobs where they're available, and so are more likely to end up in Los Angeles, New York, or Berlin than in a dying steel town in Ohio.

**The real material condition underlying right-wing populism isn't an increasing labor ***supply***, but a decreasing labor ***demand***, as capital flight/destruction reduce the availability of good jobs.** The fall of Soviet communism in the late 80s/early 90s opened Warsaw Pact countries (incl. the former East Germany) to foreign competition, whereupon their heavy industries withered away. The signing of NAFTA and formation of the WTO ca. 1995 likewise led to the final liquidation and offshoring of the already-hurting Rust Belt. In the wake of the 2008 financial crash, the harsh debt-repayment terms Germany imposed on Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain reduced demand and investment in those countries. The only response the ""populist right"" has to these developments is to offer capitalists tax cuts and weak labor/environmental laws in hopes of getting them back, the same way a battered wife might keep giving her abusive, unfaithful husband second chances in the hope that he changes. And it's all by design, because the ""populist right"" is a tool of capital that thrives on high unemployment and a cowed working class.",2021-10-16 09:31:34,72

274,qpijf4,christmas__rose,Observations on Versus-Populism,"Yesterday at Mass, before the final blessing, the priest paused and surveyed the congregation. Then he began a fireside chat. He told us that our responses at Mass were abysmal, he opened the hymnal and pointed to where we could find our lines, and then he led us in practicing to say our lines loudly and enthusiastically. 

He was right. The responses were abysmal. The first generations in more than a millennium to have the treasures of the Mass and the Scriptures opened for our comprehension, and we arrive five minutes late in our t-shirts and jeans, sit in the back half of the church on the ends of pews and near the exits, and we half-attentively mumble some lines. A few people open hymnals and pretend to sing. Others don’t even do that; they just stand with their arms crossed and stare into empty space. 

Is this the renewal envisioned by the Second Vatican Council? Surely not. And why have we grown indifferent so quickly? The priest’s paternal correction felt like a memory of middle school drama class, the teacher trying to pump up the fidgeting boys in the back who didn’t want to be there and could scarcely be bribed to mumble their lines in the play. 

It has often been observed that the *versus populum* stance at Mass turns the priest into a performer and the congregation into an audience, but yesterday I realized also that it turns the congregation into performers and the priest into an audience. While the traditional Mass affords the priest the opportunity and obligation to focus intently on the Sacrifice at all costs, how distracting and tedious it must be for a priest to have an abysmal performance unfolding before him while he is celebrating the Sacrifice of the Mass.",2021-11-08 11:31:42,24

277,qm7d17,JTCMuehlenkamp,What if every team was named after the most abundantly populated animal in their geographical area?,"Given the recent controversies over certain sports team names and the imminent rebranding of the Cleveland Indians as the Cleveland Guardians, I can't help but wonder what animal mascots would best represent the cities or states their teams reside in.        
          
Take the Tigers for example. When you think of Detroit, you do not think of a jugle ruled over by apex feline predators. I don't know if the Detroit zoo has any tigers, or if Detroit even has a zoo for that matter,  but I am 100% certain that there is at least 1 species of animal in Detroit and the surrounding areas that is more populous than tigers. The difficult part, however, is determining *which* animal is the most populous.       
        
With that in mind, it also gives rise to the concern that some teams would likely share the same name in this scenario due to their close proximity. Both Chicago and New York each have 2 teams, plus the Angels like to pretend that Los Angeles does as well, so there is bound to be some overlap. I have decided that this is okay, primarily because there is no way around it. Just to avoid any confusion as to which identically named team is which though, I'll break up this list by divisions. Anyway though, this is what the MLB would look like if all the teams had to rebrand as the most common animal in their region.

Any person with a media audience of any kind larger than 5,000 is legally required to give people a chance to rebut anything they say about them in front of the same audience hearing the criticism.  If you do not do so the person you are talking about may sue you for slander/libel receiving at a minimum 1 week's revenue from your outlet and at a maximum a year of revenue.

This means that you must reach out to the person you are talking about, show them what you are going to say, and let them either appear on your outlet to defend themselves or prepare/pre-record a response that *you must air with your criticism*.  The request must happen at least 1 week prior to publication.  You may not alter your content to rebut their response without giving them another week to rebut your rebuttal.

Reputable news outlets already do this voluntarily - they reach out to people they write about and then either publish the response or publish that the individual declined to respond (no comment).

Today, because I got a little emotional about the 34th anniversary of Mayor Washington's untimely death a week on 11/25 this year, I was inspired to tell a story which is about 40% educational, 10% sad, and about 50% just genuinely hilarious. So let's get into it! 

[William Hale Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hale_Thompson) was the last Republican Mayor of Chicago. You'll understand why by the end of this story. 

""Big Bill"" Thompson first stepped into the Chicago Political Tidepool as an alderman of the area now known as the Loop & Near North Side (wealthiest, most business-dominated parts of Chicago).

Widely regarded as a ""political chameleon"" throughout his career, Thompson ran for mayor in 1919. When the business community went against him, he appropriated socialist rhetoric and accused them of being tax dodgers & crooks; when white Chicagoans were against him, he simultaneously pandered to black communities while also accusing his opponent of daring to favor interracial marriage; he appealed to ethnic Irish-Americans by *strongly* arguing for Irish Independence; and with the vote split between a worker's candidate, a ""radical centrist"" independent, the incumbent Democratic mayor, Mr. Thompson won the election with something like 37% of the vote, representing around 10% of all Chicagoans.

By 1923, Mayor Thompson had demonstrated himself to be absurdly corrupt - and more importantly, disloyal, as he stupidly blocked his (former) ally Frank Lowden from becoming the GOP Presidential nominee in 1920 instead of Harding - to such an extent that he lost the support of a 1920s urban Republican Party, so he ""faked a heart attack"" Pierce Hawthorne style and was not nominated again for the mayoral race, citing health issues. At this point, Mayor William Emmett Dever (the 2nd best Mayor of Chicago) was elected - he proceeded to nationalize (municipalize?) a couple companies, crush both the North Side Gang (Irish) and the Chicago Outfit (Italian) and their bootlegging revenues.

Well after being forced into Cicero and having to run his bootlegging op out of *a suburb* (🤮), Al Capone was *pissed*, and decided to up the violence - he organized more public, more brutal attacks against ""his competitors"" and with the perceived inability to ""control the city"", Mayor Dever lost popularity.

Al Capone proceeded to *openly bankroll* former-mayor Thompson's campaign for the election of 1927. He had goons show up to the Chicago Republican Primary; if such a thing couldn't be more crooked, Al Capone's guys were *literally* popping off grenades at polling places to scare off Thompson opponents (search ""The Pineapple Primary"" for more info). In the meantime, ol' Bill had rebranded himself in the public eye as ""Big Bill The Builder"" - as you'd expect, stroking himself off politically for a couple of mundane essential infrastructure project. He also participated in some ridiculous campaign stunts - he stood up on a debate stage and argued with two live rats standing in for his opponents, he held massive parades throughout the city, he dressed up like a cowboy and rode with a posse on horseback down Michigan Ave. (for context - this was *ridiculously weird* even for the time; it got headlines). He pledged to his Irish-American supporters that if he ever met King George he'd break his nose.

But what's funnier than all of that? *It worked* - ""Big Bill"" Thompson was again elected mayor in 1927. He celebrated his (nominally ""dry"" campaign - pro-prohibition) with a victory party which took the form of a *massive rager* on his personal speakeasy/yacht in Belmont Harbor, which sank that day. Still there at the bottom of Lake Michigan today.

During his second mayoralty, Mayor Thompson was just as corrupt as before, but was far more paranoid & reactive - regularly attempting to dismiss high-ranking city employees of being ""British agents"", being insufficiently patriotic, picked arbitrary ego-fights with members of his own party at the national level (particularly the McCormicks).

With the city sick and tired of Mayor Thompson's antics, he was challenged in 1931 by Anton Cermak; a Czech immigrant who served as the President of the Cook County Board, ridiculously and absurdly corrupt as a party boss of the Cook County Democratic Party, but he looked like a goddamn angel compared to the ""literally endorsed by Al Capone"" Mayor Thompson... Mayor Thompson of course resorted to racism. With the 1933 World's Fair approaching and to be held in Chicago, ""the political chameleon"" took to the campaign trail, put together one of his famous rallies which packed the streets of Chicago, and uttered the now-infamous screed:

> I won't take a back seat to that Bohunk, Chairmock, Chermack or whatever his name is.

> Tony, Tony, where's your pushcart at?

> Can you picture a World's Fair mayor with a name like that?

Mr. Cermak simply replied, to a much smaller crowd, though *aggressively* capitalized on by the local press who'd hated Thompson the entire time, and immortalized in Chicago history as the ultimate ""ethnic white"" bitch slap to a WASP chauvinist motherfucker shitting on immigrants:

> He doesn't like my name...It's true I didn't come over on the Mayflower, but I came over as soon as I could.

Collectively, the entire city went ""holy shit, you fucking killed [him] dude!"" and, in a final blow to Mayor Thompson's reputation, Mr. Cermak was elected Mayor of Chicago; and proceeded to allegedly take a bullet for FDR when he visited Miami with the President (fucking Florida amirite?) and die at 59.

After his death, nearly $2 million (nearly $30 million modern money) was discovered in a safe deposit box owned by Thompson, believed to be a collection of bribes and embezzlement. 

Now what's the educational part here? Well, this story is fucking *peak America* - we've got corruption, organized crime, nativism, populism, ""flag-shagging"" - I forget who you are, random GZD British comrade, but I will always love that expression you taught me lol, and a piece of shit getting his just desserts because *a different* corrupt liberal called him a racist and a bunch of people agreed. It's like a fucking storyline from The West Wing designed to make libs cream their pants.

That's America, baby, absolutely nothing to be salvaged once we socialist revolutionaries inevitably win - fuck Rudy Giuliani, ""Big Bill"" Thompson is ""America's Mayor""! I defy you to show me a more prototypical American Politician™ than Mayor Thompson?!

I'd like to close with some words from a different ""Big Bill"" - a hero of mine, a former labor advisor to Lenin's Soviet Government - ""Big Bill"" Haywood:

> If you were a bum without a blanket; if you had left your wife and kids when you went west for a job, and had never located them since; if your job had never kept you long enough in a place to qualify to vote; if you slept in a lousy, sour bunkhouse, and ate food just as rotten as they could give you and get by with it; if deputy sheriffs shot your cooking cans full of holes and spilled your grub on the ground; if your wages were lowered on you when the bosses thought they had you down...if every person who represented law and order and the nation beat you up, railroaded you to jail, and the good Christian people cheered and told them to go to it, how in hell do you expect a man to be patriotic?

307,qw69yx,AscensionBeam,Pfizer Vaccine is Using STERILIZATION Delivery Techniques Developed by SpayVac. The DPX Delivery System was Designed for Sterilizing Animal Populations. (ALL SOURCES. MUST READ.),"Buckle up. This is long but important. The other thread on SpayVac missed a massive point regarding the Pfizer vaccine. This is a potential nail in the coffin for Pfizer - SpayVac's DPX lipid nanoparticle delivery system.

SpayVac produces the PZP infertility vaccine. They licensed their DPX lipid nanoparticle delivery technology to Pfizer for them to make the COVID vaccine. 

https://spayvac.com/f/covid-19-on-everyones-mind

The PZP vaccine doesn't cause immediate sterility - it takes over a year to appear. (Funny, Pfizer only studied a few months.) But PZP causes short term menstrual cycle changes as the immune system attacks the ovary cells. The SAME menstrual changes are being seen in women WORLDWIDE. 

https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-vaccine-impact-on-menstrual-cycle-30000-report-changes-2021-9

PZP requires storage temperatures down to -40C, unusual for most vaccines. Also, it requires two first shots given 2-6 weeks apart then a booster from 6-12 months, depending on species.

They created the DPX liposome technology to make sure the vaccine reaches its target destination and patented it under IMV Inc. IMV partnered with Pfizer in 2020 to produce the COVID vaccine, using the same liposome technology, now called the lipid nanoparticle delivery system.

This DPX lipid nanoparticle system is designed as a ""NO-RELEASE"" system. It will NOT release anything at the injection site. Rather only at the ""target destination"", which for the PZP vaccine was the ovaries and, also, the spleen which had similar receptors.

https://www.imv-inc.com/the-dpx-platform

The Pfizer injection also concentrates at the spleen and ovaries. Makes sense as they use the identical delivery system. Look at the below source in Table 2. Look at the concentration, NOT the % dose of injection. The small intestines have a huge % of dose but they are way larger than the ovaries. The ovaries have a massive concentration in regards to their size.

https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/covid-19-vaccines-dont-affect-ovaries-or-fertility-in-general-the-vaccines-are-highly-effective-at-preventing-illness-and-death/

THEY ARE LYING TO YOU

IT IS DESIGNED TO NEVER RELEASE ANYTHING AT THE INJECTION SITE.

It stays at the injection site, but the lipid nanoparticle will ONLY open at the target site. So effectively anything at the injection site is inactive and waiting to be released. This works like a long-acting drug. It will never open and release the treatment/mRNA at the site of injection - only as the lipid nanoparticle shella migrate from the injection site to a target destination will they open up and release the treatment.

The way the PZP vaccine works is it triggers an immune response against the invasive pig ovary eggs. The immune system then creates antibodies for the pig egg, but it goes overboard and targets parts that are also on the normal non-invasive eggs. Over time after reexposure, or in the case of the DPX delivery system a long term release, the normal non-invasive eggs will be viewed as hostile and attacked.

The Pfizer vaccine works in a SIMILAR WAY. The DPX delivery system brings the mRNA vaccine to the ovaries (and other areas). The lipid nanoparticle opens and releases mRNA which will convert ovary cells into a virus/ovary hybrid that the immune system will attack. Once it kills the mutated ovary cell, it will mark various parts of the ""pathogen"" with antibodies. This has a HIGH CHANCE over repeat exposure it will view the ovary cells and eggs themselves as hostile, potentially causing the immune system to attack ovary cells. 

Please share this. They are using a delivery system developed by a company that was designed to sterilize animal populations. The fact that infertility as an outcome is disregarded and wasn't even tested despite this knowledge should be criminal.

Sources:

https://spayvac.com/f/history-of-spayvac-pzp-single-dose-efficacy

https://spayvac.com/about-spayvac

Edit: Also, the mRNA vaccine has a chance that it will target other cells too via the same mechanism. The circulatory system being the carrier of the lipid shells means when the shell breaks down, it will target the nearest heart/vein cells. Then, our immune system attacks the converted cell and gets antibodies for the spike.. but also creates antibodies for the innocent cell parts. Then, upon each re-exposure to the vaccine, the immune system has a stronger reaction and produces antibodies to attack the virus but also the unaffected heart/veins which it previously identified as being part of the virus.

The mRNA vaccine is the same method to the SpayVac PZP vaccine technique - make the body target innocent cells. However, the heart and vein cells may be unitended consequences of the true delivery mechanism to the ovaries (and presumably, testes).

Edit 2:

ANALOGY TIME! This is how turning healthy ovarian cells into spike protein mutants is a bad idea. 

It's like a normal Yellow Toyota Corolla car. Totally normal and safe, right? But then a theif breaks in and steals it for a joyride. The police stop the car, kill the thief and put out a wanted posted for any of his friends. But then they see the car and also put out wanted posters for cars that are 1) Yellow and 2) Toyota Corollas. (Then the body gets a booster vaccine) Suddenly, the cops see MORE Yellow Toyota Corollas driven by thieves and they say ""OK, this isn't a coincidence. It keeps happening over and over, these Corollas are bad news. Destroy ALL the Yellow Toyota Corollas.""",2021-11-17 12:58:31,1552

The resultant vacuum has rendered entire communities, people with real grievances, vulnerable to far-right opportunists, the likes of Marine Le Pen in France, Trump in the US and Matteo Salvini in Italy.

The above are self-serving politicians with disturbing political ideas, often chauvinistic ideologies and, of course, personal ambitions. With no one else challenging mainstream politicians and corporate media, they are often welcomed as liberators, ‘draining the swamps’ of Washington and wherever else political elitism exists.

Some of us may avoid this uncomfortable discussion altogether, probably out of fear of being branded as belonging to the wrong crowd or, possibly, as a result of our insistence on understanding the world from our own limited political and ideological vantage points. But, by doing so, we are failing at truly analyzing the roots of the current political mayhem.

True, there have been attempts in mainstream media to offer a third way of thinking on the subject, but most of these ideas remain limited in their scope and context, and often bashful in their language. For example, a recent New York Times article linked the anti-vaccination movement to the ‘COVID cultural war’ in Europe, but hardly delved deep enough into the economic and class component of that division.

While the “vaxxers” and the “anti-vaxxers” may carry on to mobilize around whatever system of beliefs they hold dear, it is not the responsibility of the intellectual to follow the diktats of superficial identity politics. What is required is a true understanding of the roots behind these cultural and political phenomena, with the hope of engaging and fixing as opposed to simply condemning the ‘other side’.

The late Italian anti-fascist intellectual, Antonio Gramsci, had written about the “intellectual’s error” of judging without truly understanding, feeling and “being impassioned”. According to him, no knowledge is possible “without feeling the elementary passions of the people, understanding them and therefore explaining and justifying them in the particular historical situation”.

There are hundreds of millions of people with real grievances, justifiable fears and understandable confusion. If we do not engage with all people on an equal footing for the betterment of humankind, they are left to seek answers from the ‘prophets of doom’ – far-right chauvinists and conspiracy theorists. This cannot possibly be the only option.

337,qyy9mp,Regina_Phalange_MD,a groundbreaking study out of UMichigan in 2019 that showed newly minted physicians who just started their specialty training (residency) will have their DNA age six times faster than the normal population.,"Found this posted on another sub:


https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31230727/

The telomeres at the end of DNA— which are sort of like aglets at the end of a shoelace—shrink 6 times faster when newly minted doctors are introduced to the new stress of training (long work hours 80-120hrs/week, little sleep, life and death situation etc).

Telomere shortening is a well-known hallmark of both cellular senescence and organismal aging. Telomere length is thus considered one of the most consequential biomarkers of chronological ageing, it’s maximum at birth and progressively decreases with age.

And it is irreversible.

&nbsp;

“I’ll tell you who’s really behind this. It’s Bandaranaike and his Sinhalese fascists, they want to treat us like cattle!”

“The Left did all the work to win us our freedom, and now those fat cats in Colombo think they can just take all the credit?”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

“The Republic is just a ploy to have the Tamils rule the whole country. The British understand, they want democracy.”

&nbsp;

“Senanayake is just scared we’ll take over all his plantations. In the end, it just comes down to class, you see?”

&nbsp;

*****

&nbsp;

The announcement of a 1961 independence date of Sri Lanka only divided the soon-to-be independent country further. Leftists quickly realized that the announcement was meant to outflank their own independence movement, and create a state with limited leftist political participation. Well, not just Leftists - the British ploy was pretty obvious. The main difference came between people who thought independence was needed as soon as possible, domestic issues be damned, and people who could tolerate a few more years of colonial rule to put down the Tamils and Communists.

The Left responded by claiming that they had negotiated with the big-tent Congress Alliance to cooperate in securing independence from the British but had been rejected due to their demands for immediate elections and franchise for Indian Tamils. Congress responded by claiming that the Left had threatened Congress with political violence. Distrust between supporters of each political grouping only grew.

&nbsp;

Then, the British arrived. Troop transports arrived in Trincomalee and Colombo carrying the elite 6th Airborne Division. Wishing to avoid violence, the leftist leadership urged their supporters to stay home and avoid confrontation with the British. Even though the declaration of the Republic is still nominally in effect, the LSSP and CPC have made motions to cooperate with the Congress government in building an independent Ceylon which is part of the British Commonwealth. British troops have peacefully occupied the vast majority of the country - passive resistance is common in many areas, but only in a few isolated rural areas have the most hardline independence fighters chosen violence, only to be quickly subdued.

On the other hand, attempts by Britain to apprehend and court-martial members of the Ceylon Defense Force who had deserted in the face of independence protests have met massive resistance. The general public seems broadly opposed to punishing the deserters. Curiously enough, the CDF itself (or what remains of it) seems broadly loyal to the British and opposed to communism. Composed largely of middle-class volunteers, the force is rather reluctant to serve the British during the twilight of British rule, but the soldiers have a vested interest in maintaining order. CDF units have generally performed their basic internal security duties competently albeit without much conviction.

On the balance, the Leftists lost the support of many middle-class Sinhalese who had reluctantly supported them as an end to independence but continued to gain support among the working class, especially Indian Tamil plantation workers and urban trade unionists, Sinhalese and Tamil alike.

&nbsp;

However, the most important political development came not from the Left but from within Congress. The divide between Bandaranaike’s Sinhala Maha Sabha and the Congress center-right represented by the big-tent United National Party and its leader Dudley Senanayake had grown increasingly irreparable during the 50s, and with independence secured, the Congress alliance appears to have outlived its usefulness. The Sinhala Maha Sabha, a populist movement, had grown increasingly alienated from the elitist consensus politics practised by the UNP. Even when he was still part of the Congress alliance, Bandaranaike had given a number of speeches criticizing the UNP for failing to support “true Sri Lankan independence” or adopt a clear political stance on the “preservation of Sinhala culture and identity” (in simple English, he meant to say he supported a non-aligned foreign policy and making Sinhala the sole national language).

Both the United National Party and Sinhala Maha Sabha have increasingly adopted left-wing economic policies to decrease the appeal of communism among the electorate. Essentially all major parties now support some form of land redistribution from major landlords to tenant farmers. Bandaranaike, a longtime economic leftist, has gone one step further in proposing the nationalization of utilities and transportation companies.

Another wedge issue is the question of British military bases. While the UNP leadership has agreed to allow continued use of a number of current British military bases, the general populace overwhelmingly agrees that the British military has no place in Ceylon outside of training Ceylonese troops and fighting to defend Ceylon from outside aggression. Most other parties have vehemently opposed continued British military presence, and the issue continues to make the UNP in particular more unpopular by the day. Senanayake bet on popular ambivalence allowing him to pass an otherwise unpopular policy, but with the masses as mobilized as they are in a time of political division and civil unrest, he instead committed a serious political blunder. After losing most of their Tamil support during the 1950s due to their ambivalent position of voting rights for Indian Tamils, losing Sinhalese support to the Sinhala Maha Sabha or the Left Front could even prevent them from forming a government after Ceylon’s upcoming first post-independence elections.",2021-11-14 03:15:43,5

461,pvqps9,natbert-gangster,The Election of 1856 | The Era of Populism,"Verplanck left office as a wildly popular President, and the Democrats held a contentious convention to decide who shall be the successor to the incumbent President. The candidates in the Democratic Convention were Horace Greeley, Martin van Buren, Ely Moore, Jefferson Davis, James K. Polk, Sam Houston, John Breckinridge. No  candidate won an outright majority of delegates, but after 40 ballots, just at 5AM, the Vice President Robert E. Lee emerged as a compromise candidate. As a former Republican Senator appointed by a Democratic President as Vice President, and as someone with a mixed record on slavery, he heralded the accomplishments of the Verplanck administration and his service in the Mexican American war, and he made calls for National Unity. To the surprise of many Southerners, he appointed the Senator of New York John Adams Dix as his running mate.  Despite that, victory in the South is very likely. The crucial Irish, French and women voter blocs are likely to go for the Democratic candidate.
E. Lee promised to run for only one term.

On the Republican side, another contentious convention was held. John Bell prevailed on the 10th ballot, and he appointed Winfried Scott as his running mate. He ran against Fremont, Fillmore, Lincoln, Scott, Taylor and Louis Anderson. John Bell also promised to run for only one term, and he gave the standard Republican stump speech. Fremont and Lincoln delegates secured Winfried Scott's vice presidential nomination. Republicans called for higher tariffs on foreign goods so long as it didn't damage the agricultural economy of the South, the abolition of the income tax, homesteads, grants for universities, a return to the Gold Standard, opposition to further expansion of slavery, indian suffrage, and restrictions on immigration. John Bell opposed women's suffrage and the Rives  plan, which cost him many voters.

Robert E. Lee was a slaveowner himself; but, despite that, he helped several former slaves gain freedom in Liberia. Dix kept a low profile in the campaign. E. Lee campaigned on low tariffs on foreign goods, homesteads, continuing the construction of the Transcontinental railroad giving it a Southern route, ending the National Bank, eliminating the income tax on the middle class, keeping the Foote amendment as an integral part of the Constitution, rights for (white) immigrants and a neutral stance on infrastructure. Robert E. Lee campaigned on Cuban and Quebecois autonomy, and he also promised selling some federal lands to the States so they could build public schools.

The Mormon issue didn't came up in this campaign. Both candidates remained silent, but the Mormon  vote trended heavily towards Lee. Meanwhile, Indians  who were granted the right to vote were an extremely Republican group. ""The Republicans have fought hard for us since the days of Anderson and Webster, while Verplanck and Lee ignored our sacrifices during the War and shut us down in government reserves"", a tribal leader and a speaker in a Republican convention has said. Lee has spoken against Verplanck's decision, however. Lee promised to shut down Indian reserves calling them ""ghettos"" - and promised to assimilate and grant rights to them - an unorthodox position for a Democrat but one that falls under the ""Liberty and Civilization"" philosophy

We at UAS can't help but wonder what animal mascots would best represent the cities or states their teams reside in.

Take the Lions for example. When you think of Brisbane, you do not think of a jungle ruled over by apex feline predators. I don't know if the Brisbane Zoo has any tigers, or if Brisbane even has a zoo for that matter, but I am 100% certain that there is at least 1 species of animal in Brisbane and the surrounding areas that is more populous than lions. The difficult part, however, is determining which animal is the most populous.

Anyway though, this is what the AFL would look like if all the teams had to rebrand as the most common animal in their region.

469,pr6uz9,Awoogamuffins,Interesting quote by Richard Rorty. I guess the rise of anti-woke populism was perfectly predictable,"On an episode of free speech on the ""on the media"" podcast they talk about Richard Rorty. They quote this part of a book of his from 1998 which I thought you guys might appreciate:

""[M]embers of labor unions, and unorganized unskilled workers, will sooner or later realize that their government is not even trying to prevent wages from sinking or to prevent jobs from being exported. Around the same time, they will realize that suburban white-collar workers — themselves desperately afraid of being downsized — are not going to let themselves be taxed to provide social benefits for anyone else.

At that point, something will crack. The nonsuburban electorate will decide that the system has failed and start looking around for a strongman to vote for — someone willing to assure them that, once he is elected, the smug bureaucrats, tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen, and postmodernist professors will no longer be calling the shots. …

One thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past 40 years by black and brown Americans, and by homosexuals, will be wiped out. Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion. … All the resentment which badly educated Americans feel about having their manners dictated to them by college graduates will find an outlet.""

I thought it was pretty prescient, and I would argue a lot of these gurus are riding the populist wave Rorty predicted.

I can ride almost any trail I come across and am confident riding some reasonably big features, but I've never had competitive competition or strava times, I've finished events in dead last and constantly felt like everyone else around me was faster/more skilled/more confident to send anything in their path.

2 months ago I started driving shuttles for a small bike park and it was a real eye opener. After teaching people basic skills and having conversations with hundreds of customers, I realise im a much better rider with more skills and knowledge to share than I thought. 

There are a huge amount of people who will struggle on a green trail and may never progress to blues, but everyone has different goals and having a fun day out on the trails is always a good day. I've put red tape on handle bars to remind riders which brake is their front, I've had to tell people theyre wearing their helmet backwards. I've had people ride the shuttle to the top, have a look down the trails and hop back in the bus. I've also tended to 4 injuries that required medical attention, most common cause was people pushing beyond their limits, either in trail difficulty or physical exhaustion/lack of fitness.
